The ratification of the 19th Amendment, on August 18, 1920, finally secured the legal right of women to vote, but this mainly benefited white women. Despite heroic contributions to achieve suffrage, Black, Indigenous, and other women of color continued to face barriers to voting in the form of poll taxes, restrictive local laws, and hostile intimidation. This mosaic, called 'Our Story: Portraits of Change,' attempts to show a more complex history of the fight for American women's right to vote.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xXentMuAjcVPVx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VolcanoLlaima_EN-US0109967122_800x600.jpg" alt="Volcano Llaima with Araucaria trees in the foreground"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Volcano Llaima with Araucaria trees in the foreground</h2><p class="date">March 2, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's nearly autumn in Chile, where signs of the season vary widely as one travels from the Atacama Desert in the north more than 2,600 miles south to the tip of Tierra del Fuego.

It's estimated she helped free more than 300 slaves on 19 trips north, communicating with coded songs and maps. Tubman is widely regarded as the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad.

It's common for cool, moist marine air to rise and form dense clouds over bodies of water, then for the clouds to evaporate as they drift over warmer, drier land. The opposite is happening here: Puffs of clouds are forming over land, but not over water. That's because Madagascar's tropical rainforests are warm and wet enough that evaporating moisture rises as the day heats up. When it rises high enough, the moisture encounters cooler air, which condenses the water into clouds. Generally speaking, clouds will form where the air is rising, which in this case is only over the land.

Covering over 623 square miles in the interior of the island, the park is home to an incredible diversity of flora and fauna. Marsupials like Bennett's wallabies, quolls, Tasmanian pademelons, wombats, Tasmanian pygmy possums, and the legendary Tasmanian devils, as well as short-beaked echidnas and platypuses, can be found in its ancient forests and lakes.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BoRZXvIeUaAQTT.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MadHares_EN-US7045432576_800x600.jpg" alt="Mountain hare running across snow-covered upland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Mountain hare running across snow-covered upland</h2><p class="date">March 27, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The mountain hare is doubly hard to catch sight of, because along with its tremendous speed, it's terrifically well camouflaged. These two traits help the iconic species survive in the rugged mountains and uplands of northern Europe and Asia—this hare is dashing across a heath in the Scottish Highlands. When they have to, these speedy leporids can dart away as fast as 50 mph, at least for short distances, allowing them to outrun predators and disappear safely into the heather. But a would-be predator may not even spy them to begin with—mountain hares change coats, or molt, several times a year, their fur going from brown and gray in summer, to white-gray in winter, helping them to blend into their surroundings whatever the season.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pCpvqJxmMqKYwQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JeffersonCherries_EN-US7147255858_800x600.jpg" alt="The Jefferson Memorial during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Jefferson Memorial during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington</h2><p class="date">March 28, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The National Cherry Blossom Festival is always a highlight of spring in our nation's capital. It's timed for the peak bloom date (usually the last week in March or first week of April) when most of the blossoms are open on the cherry trees that surround the Tidal Basin. The trees were originally a gift from Japan, planted in Washington in 1912. While some Cherry Blossom Festival events are virtual this year, the trees will decorate the city as usual—just as they do in this photo framing the Jefferson Memorial. This year's festival began on March 20 and runs until April 11. It includes in-person tours and activities visitors can do on their own, as well as virtual viewings and an online Celebration Show that debuts on April 9.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YjOwEEPKgawZcX.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Reynisfjara_EN-US7429542895_800x600.jpg" alt="Reynisdrangar (basalt rock formations) on Reynisfjara Beach"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Reynisdrangar (basalt rock formations) on Reynisfjara Beach</h2><p class="date">March 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Any visitor to Iceland knows that driving the Ring Road rewards the traveler with incredible changing landscapes. Today, we're taking a quick detour to visit this chiseled stretch of Iceland's southern coast, where black sand beaches meet spiky basalt sea stacks. This is Reynisfjara Beach, widely considered the most beautiful example of Iceland's black sand beaches. The sea stacks fronting the beach are known as Reynisdrangar and were formed when a volcano erupted, spewing flowing lava that cooled into these formations. Ask the locals how they formed, however, and you may get a different story, one involving trolls and a battle with a three-masted ship.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hNLsTkxsQxfdVo.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwordFern_EN-US7523587413_800x600.jpg" alt="Detail of an ostrich fern in spring"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Detail of an ostrich fern in spring</h2><p class="date">March 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Each of these tiny fern appendages, known as fronds, is made up of even tinier leaves—but they won't be tiny for long.

The remainder of Raja Ampat is made up of roughly 1,500 smaller islands, cays, and shoals—astonishingly, hundreds of these tiny islands have yet to be explored by humans.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/HaINobIThZGcuh.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldMine_EN-US9932494168_200x200.jpg" alt="Ancient Roman gold mining site of Las Médulas"></div><div class="explore-label">Ancient Roman gold mining site of Las Médulas</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xXentMuAjcVPVx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VolcanoLlaima_EN-US0109967122_200x200.jpg" alt="Volcano Llaima with Araucaria trees in the foreground"></div><div class="explore-label">Volcano Llaima with Araucaria trees in the foreground</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/bdojhdMXCXuqPW.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PadarIsland_EN-US0491336626_200x200.jpg" alt="Komodo National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Komodo National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/rWHqwyxArcEAOL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RollingHills_EN-US0930573674_200x200.jpg" alt="Foothills of the Diablo Range in the East Bay region of Northern California"></div><div class="explore-label">Foothills of the Diablo Range in the East Bay region of Northern California</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QQkrJpIPmqdcbU.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HallesWood_EN-US9545891830_200x200.jpg" alt="Bluebell flowers carpet the Hallerbos forest floor"></div><div class="explore-label">Bluebell flowers carpet the Hallerbos forest floor</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
