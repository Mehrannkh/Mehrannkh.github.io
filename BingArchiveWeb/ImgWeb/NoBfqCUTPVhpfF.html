Meet the gnome—known as 'tomte' in Sweden and 'nisse' in Norway—whose traditions vary across regions. Rooted in Scandinavian folklore, these tiny guardians watch over homes and farms, keeping families safe through long, dark winters. But there's a catch: treat them kindly, or they may play tricks. A warm bowl of porridge on Christmas Eve is their favorite reward. Said to bring luck and laughter, they might even befriend your garden gnomes, since they often resemble them.<br><br>Gnomes are also believed to possess deep knowledge of nature and the secrets of the earth, which explains their role as loyal protectors. Over time, these helpers have swapped their work clothes for red hats and festive charm, evolving into the Christmas gnomes we know today. Handmade with wool, felt, and faux fur, they now fill Christmas markets with color and character. Look closely and you'll notice no two are the same—some mischievous, others sweet, all with stories woven into every seam. So, the next time one catches your eye at a Christmas market, take it as a quiet offer of protection.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202512.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./PwUtCOofjGTsDE.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./csrgOmgjBjiVNa.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
