There are millions of Native Americans across the US, with hundreds of tribes and groups, each with their own culture. In Arizona, Canyon de Chelly National Monument preserves the ruins of Indigenous tribes that have lived here over the past 5,000 years, including Ancestral Puebloans, who built the ancient village in our homepage image, and the Navajo, who arrived here around 1700. Carved by the relentless forces of nature, the canyon is owned by the Navajo people who manage it in cooperation with the National Park Service.

Fallow deer are native to Europe and parts of Asia and are a common sight in England, where they were introduced by the Normans in the 11th century. During the autumn rutting season, mothers stay close to their young while the males, which have broad palmate antlers, spar to establish their dominance. Our homepage doe and fawn are pictured in 850-acre Bradgate Park in Leicestershire, a medieval deer park set within woodlands and a beautiful landscape in England's East Midlands region.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/fPrwqJflYsbdMF.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RioNegro_EN-US4106999854_800x600.jpg" alt="Río Negro"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Río Negro</h2><p class="date">November 27, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">From its source in Colombia, the Río Negro flows about 1,400 miles to become one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River at the Meeting of Waters in Manaus, Brazil. It is also the largest blackwater river in the world, its water stained by decomposing organic matter that seeps in from swamps. These slow-moving, dark waters beautifully reflect the colors of the sky, including the rainbows which form over the Amazon basin, as seen here. The river also plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, as the home of many plants and animals, including the critically endangered Brazilian barefaced tamarin, the giant river otter, and nearly 700 species of fish.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vHVfOAvIhVdIHP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HumanKindness_EN-US4254216907_800x600.jpg" alt="Giant land art fresco by artist Saype in Istanbul"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Giant land art fresco by artist Saype in Istanbul</h2><p class="date">November 28, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">As we get caught up in the hustle and bustle of gift shopping and festive decorations, it's good to remember the true spirit of times like these: generosity and kindness. That's where Giving Tuesday comes in. This annual holiday on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving was created by the United Nations Foundation and New York's 92nd Street Y—a cultural organization and community center—in 2012. Their vision was to make a difference by providing joy to everyone through acts of charity. Generosity is something we can all practice, whether by volunteering at a non-profit organization, shelter or food bank, donating to a charity, or simply giving a voice to people in need in your community. So, let's jump on board with the millions of kind souls, shake hands, and share warm wishes far and wide!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/KrJKjBwYPjBmYF.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TreeLighting_EN-US4396317497_800x600.jpg" alt="Rockefeller Center Christmas tree"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Rockefeller Center Christmas tree</h2><p class="date">November 29, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">As December approaches, New York gears up for a sparkling spectacle. On November 29, the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting will bring you festive vibes. The roots of this holiday tradition go back to 1931, when builders put up a balsam fir to show gratitude for their jobs amid the bleakness of the Great Depression. That tree was decorated with paper garlands and tin cans and in 1933 the first tree-lighting ceremony took place. Today, this towering Norway spruce is adorned with over 50,000 multicolored LED lights and topped with a Swarovski crystal star. The illumination of the 80-foot tree is a full-blown extravaganza with musical performances and celebrity sightings. Its mesmerizing glow marks the official arrival of the holiday season in the city that never sleeps, and you don't want to miss it!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jsDYNsAnynpseb.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrotternishStorr_EN-US4700593682_800x600.jpg" alt="The Storr"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Storr</h2><p class="date">November 30, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Scotland's fantastical landscapes are steeped in folklore and myths.

So named because it is said to resemble a craggy man when viewed from the right angle, it has long inspired tales of giants and magic. The Old Man towers over the Trotternish Ridge, a 20-mile-long landslip that is home to many stunning and strange rock formations, each with their own stories.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/WbHsHhtShhJRgI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BadlandsSunrise_EN-US7576048436_200x200.jpg" alt="Badlands National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Badlands National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qsDPqupieqbTjx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DiwaliAyodhya_EN-US7782727326_200x200.jpg" alt="Lamps on the banks of the Sarayu River for Diwali"></div><div class="explore-label">Lamps on the banks of the Sarayu River for Diwali</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/UloDDlEOwWJbqJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SilencioSpain_EN-US6874925537_200x200.jpg" alt="Quartzite formation"></div><div class="explore-label">Quartzite formation</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FqKVbiHXtpDAQu.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HallofMosses_EN-US3167567374_200x200.jpg" alt="Hall of Mosses trail in the Hoh Rain Forest"></div><div class="explore-label">Hall of Mosses trail in the Hoh Rain Forest</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/SsXyGzpugcIhvg.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeaNettles_EN-US6654060294_200x200.jpg" alt="Pacific sea nettles off the coast of Carmel"></div><div class="explore-label">Pacific sea nettles off the coast of Carmel</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
