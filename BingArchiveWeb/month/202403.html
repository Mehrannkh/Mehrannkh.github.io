Today, let's take a moment to highlight a crucial step that was taken for a more representative democracy—the women's suffrage movement. This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone spearheaded this effort, which culminated in the historic 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. Over a hundred years later, women now hold 28% of seats in Congress, a dramatic leap forward from the past and a reminder of progress still to be made.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qpKwzKYgundBfG.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ModicaItaly_EN-US3843446204_800x600.jpg" alt="Modica"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Modica</h2><p class="date">March 2, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">When Italy comes to mind, iconic cities like Milan, Rome, and Venice often steal the spotlight.

Every year on March 27, the curtains rise to thunderous applause in celebration of World Theater Day—an ode to an art form that has influenced the masses for centuries. The day aims to promote theater and raise awareness of how it has preserved ancient cultures, provided social commentary throughout history, and even helped form our language. Seen in the image today is the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, a symbol of Argentina's rich theatrical heritage. Built in 1908, the theater is renowned for its grand architecture and exceptional acoustics, making it one of the world's premier opera houses. Over the years, it has hosted performances by legendary figures such as Enrico Caruso, Richard Strauss, Lily Pons, Marina de Gabaráin, Joss Stone, Branford Marsalis, and many more. On this day dedicated to drama, let's appreciate this art form that continues to narrate stories in the most spectacular way!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BzCLVWvPZEKPvR.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ShanghaiBlossoms_EN-US2613653434_800x600.jpg" alt="Cherry blossoms in Shanghai"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Cherry blossoms in Shanghai</h2><p class="date">March 28, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In spring, nature puts on a vibrant display, marking the start of the season with the bloom of cherry blossoms. Around the globe, from Japan to the United States, this spectacle captivates millions of hearts. In China, cherry blossoms, known as 'Yinghua,' bloom from late March to late April, adorning landscapes with delicate hues of pink and white. Revered for centuries by the Chinese, these fragile petals hold profound significance in their traditions, symbolizing renewal, hope, and the transient nature of life. Among popular places to see them are Wuhan's East Lake Cherry Blossom Park, Lu Xun Park in Shanghai, and Beijing's Yuyuantan Park. Cherry blossoms look similar to plum blossoms, but an easy way to distinguish between the two is to look at their petals. Cherry blossom petals have split ends, but plum blossoms don't.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gpBKGmogkAfyFa.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SouthStackLight_EN-US2733077237_800x600.jpg" alt="South Stack Lighthouse at sunset"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">South Stack Lighthouse at sunset</h2><p class="date">March 29, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Built on the rugged cliffs of Holy Island, Wales, the South Stack Lighthouse stands watch over the deep waters of the Irish Sea. The 91-foot-tall white tower has guided sailors since its completion in 1809; it provides safe passage for ships on the Dublin-Holyhead-Liverpool route. When it was built, sperm whale oil was used to light the lamps; however, over the years, the mechanism has been upgraded to more advanced technology like LED bulbs and Fresnel lenses. Automated in 1984, the lighthouse continues to serve as a vital navigational aid, with its powerful beam shining up to 28 miles. As the sun sets and the sky fills with colors, the silhouette of the South Stack Lighthouse in the dusk makes for a stunning sight. Visitors brave the 400-step descent down the steep cliff face to explore the lighthouse, including its engine room and exhibition area.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/UGBjDtCVaqaYkt.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SleepySloth_EN-US2834457510_800x600.jpg" alt="Brown-throated three-toed sloth sleeping in cecropia tree"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Brown-throated three-toed sloth sleeping in cecropia tree</h2><p class="date">March 30, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Costa Rica's forests are habitats for two sloth species: Hoffmann's two-toed sloth and the star of today's homepage, the brown-throated three-toed sloth. Despite being larger than many other tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica. Then-president Carlos Alvarado signed the initiative into law to emphasize the sloths' importance in the country's ecosystem.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aXOUnRzUfRcwhf.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HungarianEggs_EN-US3026213374_800x600.jpg" alt="Easter eggs painted by Tünde Csuhaj"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Easter eggs painted by Tünde Csuhaj</h2><p class="date">March 31, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Happy Easter! Do you like your eggs boiled or painted? The practice of painting chicken eggs, which originates from Persian traditions, was adopted by Christians in the early 17th century to commemorate this holiday, also called Pascha. Hungarian artist, Tünde Csuhaj—living and working in the small city of southern Hungary, Szekszárd—has mastered the craft. The internationally recognized egg-painter developed her own etching technique to create lace-like patterns. The meticulous designs appear on all sorts of eggs, including chicken, goose, swan, and even emu or ostrich eggs. The intricate motifs of incredible craftsmanship are often shown at national and international fairs and exhibitions. Are you inspired?
