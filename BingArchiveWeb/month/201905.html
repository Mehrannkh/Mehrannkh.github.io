The week begins with Shōwa Day, a celebration for Emperor Hirohito, and ends with Children’s Day. Many workers take the week off and travel while enjoying the spring weather.

This honor is given by an NGO called the International Bureau of Cultural Capitals, and it goes to just one city in either North, Central, or South America each year. The recognition comes with tourism marketing about the city in dozens of countries around the world, so others will learn about San Miguel de Allende’s many cultural charms and special events.This city’s history makes it a perfect destination to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Spanish for ‘Fifth of May,’ the holiday commemorates the Mexican army's 1862 victory over France at the Battle of Puebla. The victory was especially significant because the Mexicans overcame France despite having a much smaller, less equipped army. Symbolically, it provided hope for the resistance, even after the French later took over Mexico City. These days, Cinco de Mayo is more widely celebrated in the US, where it’s regarded as a celebration of Mexican culture.

The new rail line linked the established railways of the eastern United States with the rapidly expanding railroads of the West, and made transcontinental travel via train a reality.

But over the centuries, these temples were almost completely buried in sand and forgotten. It was not until the early 1800s when an explorer saw the heads of the colossal statues poking through the sand that the temples were again discovered. Then in the 20th century, construction of a dam on the Nile River formed Lake Nasser, a massive reservoir that would have flooded the site where the temples stood. To save them from inundation, the temples were disassembled and relocated to a nearby hill. The process took almost five years and required that workers cut the temples into pieces and reassemble them exactly as they were built 3,000 years ago.

But in summer in the boreal forests, it eats insects—especially the spruce budworm—with a special gusto.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/AhoaEdVGrpMkaH.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarathonduMont_EN-US3655902624_800x600.jpg" alt="Mont Saint-Michel"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Mont Saint-Michel</h2><p class="date">May 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Considered by many to be one of the most beautiful marathons anywhere, the Marathon de la Baie du Mont Saint-Michel has attracted runners from around the globe to this UNESCO World Heritage Site. The point-to-point route for the marathon was designed so runners can see the finish line at the base of the Mont Saint-Michel Abbey from the starting line on the western side of the bay, and from points along the way. But you don't need to be a runner to enjoy this historic location. Every year more than two million people travel to the tidal island, making it one of the top tourist destinations in France.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/OAJwSBkltriAkf.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VVMWDC_EN-US3757796732_800x600.jpg" alt="Visitors at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Visitors at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington</h2><p class="date">May 27, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">For Memorial Day, we're visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. More than 58,000 names of men and women who served and died in the Vietnam War are etched on the black granite V-shaped wall. In 1981, Maya Lin was just 21 and still an undergraduate at Yale when she won a nationwide public competition to design the memorial. But when her design was unveiled, its minimalist and nontraditional approach sparked controversy. Many considered it bleak and thought the black granite symbolized defeat rather than honor. To address these criticisms, and over Lin's objections, a bronze statue of three servicemen was added to the plan. Later another statue, the Vietnam Women's Memorial, was erected south of the wall. Today the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is among the most popular and revered landmarks in DC, drawing over 4.5 million visitors a year.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nvkULdXpvKXRVG.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeeWeek_EN-US3869000893_800x600.jpg" alt="Pollen-covered honey bee on a pumpkin flower"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Pollen-covered honey bee on a pumpkin flower</h2><p class="date">May 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">You might recognize our homepage friend from the logo of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, an annual US competition since 1925. Why’s it called a spelling bee? Because another meaning of ‘bee’ is any kind of gathering or meeting for collective work or competition, like a quilting bee or, yes, a spelling bee. The Scripps National Spelling Bee is being held this week in National Harbor, Maryland, and savvy spellers from grade schools and middle schools around the world will compete for top honors.If last year’s competition is any indication, it should be dramatic stuff. In 2018, more than 500 students qualified for the 91st Scripps Spelling Bee after advancing in local competitions. But it was 14-year-old Karthik Nemmani, a middle school student from McKinney, Texas, who took home the crown when he correctly spelled the word ‘koinonia.’ Another Texan, a 12-year-old girl, placed second after she stumbled over the word ‘bewusstseinslage.’ Frankly, we’re quite certain we’d stumble over that word, too. We suspect the future is bright for both competitors.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cNAGfvqUnPZGjB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StravinskyFountain_EN-US4016192027_800x600.jpg" alt="Stravinsky Fountain in Paris"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Stravinsky Fountain in Paris</h2><p class="date">May 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The whimsical sculptures of Stravinsky Fountain in Paris are a bold, modern contrast to the Church of Saint-Merri, seen in the background of our photo today. The fountain—designed to inspire feelings of joy and playfulness—is a tribute to the groundbreaking symphonic composer and conductor Igor Stravinsky. Though he was born near St. Petersburg, Russia, Stravinsky wrote and debuted many of his career-making works while living in France in the early 20th century. It was this day in 1913 that Stravinsky’s ballet ‘The Rite of Spring’ debuted at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/uXefeJcprWkCOn.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Manhattanhenge_EN-US4126401007_800x600.jpg" alt="42nd Street with the Chrysler Building during Manhattanhenge in 2018"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">42nd Street with the Chrysler Building during Manhattanhenge in 2018</h2><p class="date">May 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">A few times each year, the rising and setting suns align with the east-west streets of Manhattan.

Depending on your region, you might know them as Mima mounds, hogwallow mounds, or even pimple mounds–and their origin isn’t always clear. Theories range from seismic activity to gophers—and even just an accumulation of sediment. The prairie mounds on our homepage today are part of Oregon’s Zumwalt Prairie, a protected grassland area in northeast Oregon. Encompassing some 330,000 acres, it’s of one of the largest remaining tracts of bunchgrass prairie in North America. Once part of an extensive grassland in the region, this portion has remained preserved due to its high elevation, which made farming difficult.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/zDlXtTqGjsuNJV.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapeMayWarbler_EN-US3460417256_200x200.jpg" alt="Male Cape May warbler in spring"></div><div class="explore-label">Male Cape May warbler in spring</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cNAGfvqUnPZGjB.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StravinskyFountain_EN-US4016192027_200x200.jpg" alt="Stravinsky Fountain in Paris"></div><div class="explore-label">Stravinsky Fountain in Paris</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/NikZxVYUwRUARx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MalvarrosaSandSculpture_EN-US3310429769_200x200.jpg" alt="Sandcastle on Malvarrosa Beach in Valencia"></div><div class="explore-label">Sandcastle on Malvarrosa Beach in Valencia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MMtdVPqzXZgElI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SkelligMichael_EN-US5274283608_200x200.jpg" alt="The Skellig Islands"></div><div class="explore-label">The Skellig Islands</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YQATSAzzFCkkts.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RuffLek_EN-US5125992277_200x200.jpg" alt="Ruff male displaying its plumage"></div><div class="explore-label">Ruff male displaying its plumage</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
