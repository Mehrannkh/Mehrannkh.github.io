Constructed on the top of Hohenzollern Mountain in the 11th century, the castle was largely ruined by a 10-month siege in 1423, only to be rebuilt a few decades later. It then served as an important strategic stronghold before again falling into disrepair. In the 19th century, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, best remembered for his commitment to building great works across Germany, had a new castle built on the grounds, replacing almost all the 15th-century construction. Today, Hohenzollern Castle is an open-air museum that hosts more than 350,000 visitors per year, making it one of the most-visited castles in Germany.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wkJkToeoWMeudM.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SandhillSleeping_EN-US4023790571_800x600.jpg" alt="Sandhill cranes"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Sandhill cranes</h2><p class="date">January 3, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Hey, don't judge.

Well, sandhill cranes aren't picky; they'll eat whatever's available, from plants and grains, to insects, snails, and even snakes. And they have plenty of avian company at this beautiful refuge each winter—whooping cranes, ducks, and snow geese from as far away as Alaska and Siberia also count Bosque del Apache as a favorite resting spot before heading north to their breeding grounds when the days get warmer.

According to Italian folklore, the last three days of January are the coldest of the year and are referred to as the 'days of the blackbird.' One local legend gives a fun take on how blackbirds got their dark feathers: To protect her young chicks from the cold Northern Italian winter, a mother bird with white feathers built her nest in a chimney.

Iceboating, also known as ice sailing, began in 17th-century Europe. Travelers used vessels on blades to traverse the frozen Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea and the iced-over canals of the Netherlands. These days, the sport is enjoyed as a recreational and competitive activity using a variety of boats, boards, skates, and kites. The world championships, which fall under the broader umbrella of windsurfing competitions, have been held since 1980.
