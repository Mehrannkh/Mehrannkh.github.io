A millennium ago, Ani was a thriving Armenian capital on a major Silk Road route, its fortifications and busy streets shaping trade and culture across the region. Today, the city is quiet, but its outline still carries the weight of its past.<br><br>The image shows the Church of St. Gregory, one of Ani's most striking survivors. Built from dark volcanic stone, its tall cylindrical tower stands over the plateau with the same precision that once defined the city. Ani was known as the 'City of 1,001 Churches,' and its architects pushed new ideas in arches, domes, and facades that later influenced Gothic tradition. Even in ruin, the design remains deliberate and unmistakable.<br><br>Ani's decline unfolded through earthquakes, invasions, and shifting trade routes, yet the city never fully disappeared. Archaeologists continue to find new details, and conservation work fights erosion and time. Walking here feels less like exploring a ruin and more like meeting a city determined to keep its story alive.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202512.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./iwwpshJwoTHdZg.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./yNcpGZIoBIiygM.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
