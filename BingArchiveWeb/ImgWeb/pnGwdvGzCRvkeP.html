First the basics: We're in South Carolina looking at a beautiful American goldfinch perched atop a sunflower. While the matching color scheme makes for a great photo, it's likely this little bird has stopped for a meal. American goldfinches are among the strictest vegetarians in the bird world, preferring grains and seeds, especially sunflower seeds. That's why it's not uncommon to see them in neighborhoods with well-stocked bird feeders. In fact, human activity has generally benefited American goldfinches overall. The birds thrive in areas where forests have been removed—they prefer open meadows or fields covered in weeds.<br><br>The European goldfinch has long been kept as a pet bird, perhaps due to its ability to learn simple tricks. Meanwhile, its American cousin prattles on about potato chips. That's its signature call. The American goldfinch has several vocalizations but its most common is a twitter that sounds distinctly like it's calling out 'po-ta-to-chip, po-ta-to-chip.' In the birding community, the call is so unique and distinguishable that the American goldfinch is referred to as the 'potato chip bird.' Perhaps more interesting, the bird has been observed to distinctly oscillate as it flies, dipping down and back up, over and over, as it screams 'po-ta-to-chip' on the upswing. So, next time you have a hankering for chips, give a listen for nature's advertising agent calling out a not-so-subtle message.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202207.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./SSusyVWRdLIFrR.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./JhYqmVGUnmlWZc.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
