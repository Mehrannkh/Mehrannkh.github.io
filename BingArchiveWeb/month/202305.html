They carefully tend rice plants during the growing season, as generations have done before them, before harvesting and distributing the rice between the community. The Subak system is so important in Balinese culture, it has been recognised by UNESCO. These terraces offer visitors panoramic views over the surrounding rice fields and lush landscape, as well as a picturesque example of people living in harmony with nature.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DyDNiqQcUbAVRN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LanternFloating_EN-US4433076187_800x600.jpg" alt="Lantern floating ceremony"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Lantern floating ceremony</h2><p class="date">May 29, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">On Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives serving in the US military.

To get to it, visitors need to take a boat toward the mouth of Banderas Bay at the base of the Marietas Islands. Once there, they swim through a tunnel at low tide to reach the beach. The walls hide a sandy cove, where the turquoise waters contrast with flora-laden cliffs that perfectly frame the blue sky overhead. Playa del Amor (Lovers' Beach) is popular among tourists, but the number of visitors is limited to preserve its natural beauty and ecosystem.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/oZClHAXIpHlSlY.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WorldOtterDay_EN-US4690332709_800x600.jpg" alt="Sea otter pup"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Sea otter pup</h2><p class="date">May 31, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Watching sea otters playing in the water is always a treat. But while they look cute, these furry critters are also the top predators in their food chain, 'otterly' vital to keeping ecosystems in balance. Sea otters eat sea urchins and without them, sea urchins spread across the sea floor, destroying crucial kelp forests which provide food and shelter for many other aquatic animals. Unfortunately, sea otters are one of five otter species listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Five others are listed as near-threatened and two as vulnerable. Of the 13 otter species worldwide, only the North American river otter’s population is considered to be stable. On the last Wednesday in May, World Otter Day seeks to raise awareness about the threats to otters, and how to protect them.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/oZClHAXIpHlSlY.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WorldOtterDay_EN-US4690332709_200x200.jpg" alt="Sea otter pup"></div><div class="explore-label">Sea otter pup</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IMsgOYuuJgxKkd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EuropeanHoneybee_EN-US0859156574_200x200.jpg" alt="European honeybees in Sheffield"></div><div class="explore-label">European honeybees in Sheffield</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FFqHyTjQZvVUxp.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BiodiverseCostaRica_EN-US2611109244_200x200.jpg" alt="Arenal Volcano seen from Monteverde"></div><div class="explore-label">Arenal Volcano seen from Monteverde</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YINTKkuUZLXtXg.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OldFortress_EN-US3033490074_200x200.jpg" alt="The Old Fortress of Corfu"></div><div class="explore-label">The Old Fortress of Corfu</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/roBOltyZHCmAek.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KlostersSerneus_EN-US9360254697_200x200.jpg" alt="Jöriseen lakes in the Silvretta Alps"></div><div class="explore-label">Jöriseen lakes in the Silvretta Alps</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
