Despite their small size, Adélie penguins are sleek swimmers and can dive as deep as 575 feet in search of shrimp-like krill or fish. They are social animals that gather in small colonies for foraging, hunting, and protection. While it may seem mischievous, Adélies steal pebbles from nearby nests to strengthen their own, safeguarding their eggs and chicks from Antarctica's harsh conditions and predators.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YrbINRtDHxlNnM.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KalalochTree_EN-US5565386489_800x600.jpg" alt="Tree of Life"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Tree of Life</h2><p class="date">April 26, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The first Arbor Day in the US was held in 1872. Since then, the event has really taken root. On the last Friday of April, people across the country mark the occasion by planting trees, often dedicating them to a loved one. It's also a great day to celebrate trees themselves. As well as providing homes for countless species of animals, trees absorb carbon dioxide and clean the air we breathe. They also help to keep cities cooler and can even play a role in preventing floods.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QznfbHLcXIIuOJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeucisticHummingbird_EN-US5796079642_800x600.jpg" alt="Leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden</h2><p class="date">April 27, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Get your binoculars and field guide and head to a local park, as it's National Go Birding Day! Held on the last Saturday in April, this holiday celebrates birdwatching, an activity enjoyed by millions worldwide. There are approximately 18,000 known bird species around the world. Birds come in a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors, making them one of the most diverse groups of animals on Earth—from imposing eagles to today's tiny snowy-winged star, a leucistic Anna's hummingbird in the Australian Garden at the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum. These hummingbirds are typically vibrant in color, but leucism means some have decreased pigmentation, resulting in a paler appearance. Unlike albino birds, these hummingbirds do not have red or pink eyes. Their lighter plumage reduces protective camouflage, making them more vulnerable to predators such as hawks and feral cats.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/NlTuhqZqeijUrQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GuadalupeTexas_EN-US5906260854_800x600.jpg" alt="El Capitan at sunrise in Guadalupe Mountains National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">El Capitan at sunrise in Guadalupe Mountains National Park</h2><p class="date">April 28, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Take advantage of the last day of National Park Week! If you haven't had time to take part, we've got your back. Let us take you to Guadalupe Mountains National Park in West Texas. The park, officially established in 1972, covers 86,416 acres. Here, the Guadalupe Mountains rise over the salt dunes of the Chihuahuan Desert and include the highest point in Texas, the 8,751-foot Guadalupe Peak. Pictured on today's homepage is another iconic landmark, El Capitan. Not to be confused with its famous namesake in California, this limestone cliff towers 8,085 feet high and is often used as a waymark for travelers. Even if National Park Week is over, there are plenty of days in the year to visit the country's abundant natural splendor.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BISrdbGzxXZFMO.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TulouFujian_EN-US6009679228_800x600.jpg" alt="Fujian Tulou complex of historical and cultural heritage buildings in Fujian province"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Fujian Tulou complex of historical and cultural heritage buildings in Fujian province</h2><p class="date">April 29, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Let's step into a world of giant earthen homes designed to house a village. These 'tulou' structures, built between the 12th and 20th centuries, are the dwellings of the Hakka community in China's mountainous southeastern Fujian region. The homes are constructed from clay, sandy soil, and gray tiles, with bamboo strips serving as the support. They were built to house a whole clan, up to 800 people each. From above, these round dwellings look like giant tires or reels lying on their sides, with light walls, dark roofs, and spacious interiors.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/TqQsXvMEfnKVQS.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CheetahRain_EN-US6179670004_800x600.jpg" alt="Cheetah in morning rain"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Cheetah in morning rain</h2><p class="date">April 30, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Blink and you'll miss it!
