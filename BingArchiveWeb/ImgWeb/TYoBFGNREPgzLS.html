Estonia is one of Europe's best places to spot Eurasian otters, thanks to its clean rivers, wide wetlands, and snack-filled coastline. This protected species was named Estonia's Animal of the Year in 2024. While globally considered near threatened, their population here has grown substantially, reaching an estimated 2,000 in recent years, up from a historic low of just 300 before the turn of the millennium.<br><br>From Soomaa National Park's flooded forests to Matsalu National Park's calm shallows, these mammals—with their streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and long tails—weave through the country's waters with ease. Their thick fur traps warm air, allowing them to dive into cold Baltic currents without hesitation. While they look cute, their hunting skills are sharp: they track fish, frogs, and crustaceans with precision.<br><br>Unlike their sea otter cousins, Eurasian otters tend to work solo, but in Estonia's wetlands, neighbors aren't far away. They communicate with whistles, chirps, and occasional snorts. When pups arrive, the banks become playful classrooms where young otters learn to swim, eat, and master the 'oops, did I splash you?' face.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202601.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./ANLCTplJSlUYZr.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./oHHPlbwXmaVMyK.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
