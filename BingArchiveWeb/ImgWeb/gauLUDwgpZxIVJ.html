Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence, and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.<br><br>Proclaimed by the UN in 2011, the International Day of Friendship calls for building bonds across borders, cultures, and generations. It's a vision of peace crafted not just in policy rooms but also on playgrounds, in neighborhoods, and in public spaces—even on the ground itself. So, today, take a cue from Saype: reach out, connect, and be part of a global human chain. Sometimes, the most powerful message begins with a single gesture.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202507.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./yqlKVpkCGhhvOw.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./nWpvCNidFYinIN.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
