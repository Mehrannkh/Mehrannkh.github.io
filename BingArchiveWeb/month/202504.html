These little jumpers have been around since dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and they've evolved into some of the weirdest, coolest creatures out there. With over 4,000 known species worldwide, they come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny New Guinea Amau frog—smaller than a dime—to the large Goliath frog, which can weigh more than 7 pounds. Some, like the glass frog, are nearly transparent, while others are extremely poisonous. The golden poison frog, for example, carries enough toxin to take down 10 humans. And if you think all frogs are swamp-dwellers, meet the desert rain frog, a round little amphibian that survives in dry conditions by absorbing moisture through its skin.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tJXFwrXIsHQqqE.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UtahBadlands_EN-US3082813561_800x600.jpg" alt="Sandstone formations in the badlands near Caineville"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Sandstone formations in the badlands near Caineville</h2><p class="date">April 2, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Wavy sandstone ridges stretch across the Caineville Badlands, Utah, resembling nature's brushstrokes on stone. These formations are made of fine-grained sediment that settled in ancient river deltas and inland seas and later hardened into stone. Over time, erosion carved through the layers, exposing flowing, ripple-like patterns. The sedimentary layers tell a story of shifting climates and ancient landscapes. The barren land, seen in today's image, may appear lifeless, but during early spring, rainfall blankets the terrain with tiny purple and yellow flowers.

Nature's color wheel has long been linked to myths and legends, from Norse gods to the Irish leprechaun's pot of gold. But beyond folklore, the science behind rainbows is just as compelling. The first real explanation came from Theodoric of Freiberg, a German physicist, in 1304. He discovered that rainbows form when sunlight enters a raindrop, bends, reflects inside, and then bends again as it exits. This process splits light into its colors, creating the spectrum we see. The classic 'ROYGBIV' (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) doesn't tell the whole story—rainbows contain millions of colors blended together.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/LmtDzJAIegsntL.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CherryBlossomDC_EN-US9897772834_800x600.jpg" alt="The National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington</h2><p class="date">April 4, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Every spring, Washington, DC, transforms into a sea of pink and white as the cherry trees bloom, marking the return of the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

Since it was first documented in 1823, volcanic activity has caused the crater to fill with lava, partially collapse, erupt in fountains of lava, expand to twice its size on two occasions, and at times fill with groundwater. All this activity demonstrates the unpredictable raw power that lies below the surface of the Earth. The natural and cultural importance of this site led to the establishment of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park in 1916, and to it being named a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site in the 1980s.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BUwOIZkecNiDAd.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrangeImpala_EN-US3494359572_800x600.jpg" alt="Impala with red-billed oxpecker in Moremi Game Reserve"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Impala with red-billed oxpecker in Moremi Game Reserve</h2><p class="date">April 28, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Here's a place where the wild rules and nature moves at its own pace. Moremi Game Reserve stretches across the eastern side of Botswana's Okavango Delta, covering 1,900 square miles. Established in 1963, it became Africa's first reserve created by local people—the Batawana, a Bantu ethnic group native to Southern Africa—to protect the region's wildlife from uncontrolled hunting. The combination of permanent water and dry land makes it one of the best places in Africa to observe wildlife in its natural habitat.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MWxYmMIBlFWfvo.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GardensVillandry_EN-US3529015856_800x600.jpg" alt="Formal garden at Château de Villandry"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Formal garden at Château de Villandry</h2><p class="date">April 29, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The grass truly is greener on the other side—especially when that side is Château de Villandry. While the Loire Valley in France is packed with stunning châteaux (French for castles), Villandry stands apart, not for its towering turrets or medieval might, but for its gardens. Built in the 16th century by Jean le Breton, a minister to King Francis I, Villandry was always meant to impress. Unlike fortified castles built for war, it was designed for comfort, featuring large windows and an open, welcoming layout. Its gardens are arranged across terraces with distinct themes. The ornamental garden showcases geometric patterns like the one pictured here. The water garden offers a serene retreat, and the vegetable garden turns everyday crops into artistic displays.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/NMvhEFTVwtOMOU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ColtraneBand_EN-US3561448385_800x600.jpg" alt="Jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and band performing in 1961 in London"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and band performing in 1961 in London</h2><p class="date">April 30, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's time to jazz up—literally. From the smoky clubs of New Orleans to the bustling streets of Tokyo, jazz has crossed borders, blended cultures, and turned improvisation into an art form. Every April 30, International Jazz Day—established by UNESCO in 2011—celebrates this genre's role in promoting peace, dialogue, and unity. This music form emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, a city alive with musical traditions from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. Rooted in blues and ragtime, jazz quickly evolved, with pioneers like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald giving it a voice. What started as an American sound soon found a global audience. Swing and bebop took over dance halls, Latin jazz brought a new rhythm, and cool jazz mellowed the mood.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/ykpzrMSXNArngR.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ParoTsechu_EN-US0177055246_200x200.jpg" alt="Women in traditional dress at the Paro Tshechu Festival in Bhutan"></div><div class="explore-label">Women in traditional dress at the Paro Tshechu Festival in Bhutan</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aEwiDnaGYITlor.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlobeTheatre_EN-US3262022178_200x200.jpg" alt="Shakespeare's Globe"></div><div class="explore-label">Shakespeare's Globe</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BUwOIZkecNiDAd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrangeImpala_EN-US3494359572_200x200.jpg" alt="Impala with red-billed oxpecker in Moremi Game Reserve"></div><div class="explore-label">Impala with red-billed oxpecker in Moremi Game Reserve</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XsDpDpGxIGrUgI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpottedDolphins_EN-US0872892049_200x200.jpg" alt="Atlantic spotted dolphins near Santa Maria Island"></div><div class="explore-label">Atlantic spotted dolphins near Santa Maria Island</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mriYzOETqEByFF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LittleFoxes_EN-US8078019606_200x200.jpg" alt="Red fox cubs near their den"></div><div class="explore-label">Red fox cubs near their den</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
