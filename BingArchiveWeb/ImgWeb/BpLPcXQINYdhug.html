Our adorable tree hugger looks content thanks to its facial mask and the natural shape of its mouth. Spotting one of these slow-moving solitary animals takes a little skill. The thick outer layer of a sloth's coat is an ideal growing medium for green algae, which forms a natural camouflage in the canopy of tropical forests here in northern South America. If you do spot a pale-throated sloth it will likely be enjoying a simple meal of leaves, limbs, and tree buds. Because sloths don't have incisors, they spend most of their waking hours smacking their lips together 'to chew' their food. This would drive most animals to starvation (if not culinary madness), but the sloth's metabolism is so slow that it's evolved to survive on less food.<br><br>Our happy pale-throated sloth hangs out in the trees of Sloth Island (yes, that’s a real place). It’s a tiny island on the Essequibo River near the town of Bartica, Guyana. Let's take a cue from the sloth and slow down our own hectic lives during International Sloth Day on October 20. Who knows, we might find smiles creeping across our own faces.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/201910.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./skrLBPWhzFBWlu.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./FXBKukJjUhtTlZ.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
