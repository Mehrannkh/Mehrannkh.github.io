This 11-acre corn maze in the Poconos region of Pennsylvania boasts a unique design each fall. Don't worry, if you take a wrong turn, you won't be lost forever. 'Corn helpers' are scattered throughout the maze to help confused maze-goers find their way again, and 'tower people' keep a watchful eye over them. This year, visitors to the maze are asked to wear masks, stay at least 6 feet apart, and take other precautions, but organizers are still promising a 'spooktacular 2020.'</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cpisQvGBzGTDCZ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FishOwl_EN-US0921851280_800x600.jpg" alt="Blakiston's fish owl in Hokkaido"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Blakiston's fish owl in Hokkaido</h2><p class="date">October 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">To get us in the Halloween mood, we're offering a seldom-seen sight—the Blakiston's fish owl.

To make a scenic but imposing entryway, he had 150 beech trees planted on either side of the road (90 trees survive).
