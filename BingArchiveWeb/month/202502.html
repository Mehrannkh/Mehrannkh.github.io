The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hXsAVNijILGIkU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RibbleheadViaduct_EN-US0244245382_800x600.jpg" alt="Ribblehead Viaduct and Ingleborough mountain"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Ribblehead Viaduct and Ingleborough mountain</h2><p class="date">February 3, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Part engineering genius, part daredevil stunt—that's the Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire, England.

Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency.

The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/KhFcacEoaRfSqy.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArgyllStalker_EN-US2452683665_200x200.jpg" alt="Castle Stalker on Loch Laich"></div><div class="explore-label">Castle Stalker on Loch Laich</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eFDQbczEnETpmF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SnowySvaneti_EN-US6546788330_200x200.jpg" alt="Medieval towers in Mestia"></div><div class="explore-label">Medieval towers in Mestia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/izYLdCLVrxbyCQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PolarCub_EN-US2740470421_200x200.jpg" alt="Polar bear cub"></div><div class="explore-label">Polar bear cub</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/PKmjbEsBToKfzl.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UmbrellaDay_EN-US6816351187_200x200.jpg" alt="Art installation of umbrellas at Borough Market in London"></div><div class="explore-label">Art installation of umbrellas at Borough Market in London</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hXsAVNijILGIkU.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RibbleheadViaduct_EN-US0244245382_200x200.jpg" alt="Ribblehead Viaduct and Ingleborough mountain"></div><div class="explore-label">Ribblehead Viaduct and Ingleborough mountain</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
