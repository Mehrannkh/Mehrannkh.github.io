Designated a national park in 1971, Capitol Reef invites reflection—not just on its vivid geology, but on the ancient narratives and cultural heritage etched into its landscape.<br><br>Long before visitors laced up hiking boots and hit the trails at Capitol Reef, the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan peoples called this place home. Between 300 and 1300 CE, they lived in pit houses and natural rock shelters, weaving farming into their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their connection to the land was both spiritual and practical—and they left behind some of the park's most captivating features, including petroglyphs like those found in Fruita, featured in today's image. These rock panels showcase an ancient visual language, featuring human figures adorned with headdresses and jewelry. Alongside them are animals like bighorn sheep and lizards, as well as abstract shapes alluding to ceremonies, migrations, and celestial events. Together, they form a silent archive—a timeless record of the people who lived, moved, and made meaning in this extraordinary landscape.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202508.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./BpgcWUbJeCfkeF.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./PCCLdadgWPIoHC.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
