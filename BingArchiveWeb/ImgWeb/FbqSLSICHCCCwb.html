Even when scarred or hollowed, their trunks still send out fresh leaves each season—a living record of survival through drought, wind, and fire. In 2019, UNESCO established November 26 as World Olive Tree Day, recognizing these trees that have been cultivated by humans since about 6,000 BCE. Olives have carried both practical and symbolic weight through the ages: their oil was pressed for anointing, medicine, and daily sustenance; crowns of their leaves graced Olympic victors; and their branches became a lasting emblem of peace.<br><br>Nestled in the Balearic Sea, the Spanish island of Mallorca embodies this long story, flourishing with groves like those in the Serra de Tramuntana, photographed here. Some trees across the island are older than its medieval cathedrals. Here, olives are gently picked, pressed within hours, and transformed into an oil prized for its fruity, almond, and herbal notes. Each harvest continues a legacy: the fruit nourishes, the wood fuels fires, and the roots stabilize steep slopes. Across millennia, these companions of civilization have witnessed our progress as we witness their endurance—remaining unyielding, persistent, and remarkably green.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202511.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./DSqHfbIyIKctRs.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./wbjJviBwpdgviD.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
