It was here, in Philadelphia's Seventh Ward neighborhood during the late 1890s, that Du Bois conducted a comprehensive study of an African American community. He used methodologies—including detailed data visualizations—that were decades ahead of his time, mapping out every household and documenting the challenges that residents encountered as they tried to achieve success and happiness in the decades after Reconstruction and the dawn of the Jim Crow era.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EtoYfWMPrNOPDu.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MeerkatHuddle_EN-US3180214061_800x600.jpg" alt="Meerkat family huddling together"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Meerkat family huddling together</h2><p class="date">February 2, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Meerkats, also called suricates, are highly social animals that enjoy playing together and grooming each other.

In winter, the lake draws nature photographers interested not just in the wildlife and spectacular landscape, but also the lake's odd appearance when it freezes over. Bacteria on the lake bottom feed on dead organic matter and release the methane bubbles you see here. When the surface water freezes, the bubbles get trapped, creating a photographer's dream. They may be beautiful, but these frozen bubbles can be dangerous because they're highly flammable. If you happen to be lighting a match nearby, you'll want to watch out or the released methane could explode.

Though polar bears aren't endangered—their current conservation status is 'vulnerable'—these magnificent beasts have become a sort of mascot for the race to slow the melting of Arctic sea ice. The Arctic ice is crucial to the bears' survival, as they hunt the ringed seals that bob up through holes in the ice. As Arctic ice decreases, the polar bears' hunting ground does too.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MQfMPvzZlMAAqa.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OtterCreekVT_EN-US1557441690_800x600.jpg" alt="Otter Creek in winter"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Otter Creek in winter</h2><p class="date">February 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Otter Creek is the longest river entirely contained within the borders of Vermont and has been an important waterway since people settled in the area around 10,000 years ago. Originally an important trade route for the indigenous Abenaki, Algonquin, and Iroquois nations, it remained a vital part of the economy of the early European settlers and up through the 19th century. It winds through some of the Green Mountain State's most scenic towns, from Brandon to Middlebury to Vergennes, and empties into Lake Champlain. It is also the water source for more than one of Vermont's many microbreweries, including Otter Creek Brewery. With at least 60 breweries serving just over 600,000 people in the state, Vermonters lead the nation in beer brands per capita.

Also known as parachute frogs, these critters live in the tropical jungles of Malaysia and Borneo. They spend most of their time in trees, gliding down to the ground to mate and lay eggs. They 'fly' by leaping and using their webbed fingers and toes to glide as far as 50 feet.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/oZYltBqQnexPgJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SneezeSpring_EN-US3645892670_200x200.jpg" alt="A snowdrop in bloom"></div><div class="explore-label">A snowdrop in bloom</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gwRIkzOLmbAywi.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PingxiLantern_EN-US3795457184_200x200.jpg" alt="Lantern Festival in Pingxi"></div><div class="explore-label">Lantern Festival in Pingxi</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dZivAEUkVZBrcJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LemonDragon_EN-US7455819536_200x200.jpg" alt="The 2019 Lemon Festival in Menton"></div><div class="explore-label">The 2019 Lemon Festival in Menton</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/JRRpAdznxEqpwk.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OlindaCarnival_EN-US7914915440_200x200.jpg" alt="Giant puppets for Carnival in Olinda"></div><div class="explore-label">Giant puppets for Carnival in Olinda</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mZHNptrpBoUzaz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AcadiaSunrise_EN-US8474021804_200x200.jpg" alt="Acadia National Park in Maine"></div><div class="explore-label">Acadia National Park in Maine</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
