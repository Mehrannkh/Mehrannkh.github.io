The creamy stripes and dashes on its coat help keep this endangered calf camouflaged under the filtered light of the Amazon tree canopy. It may look small now, but mature tapirs are the largest native mammals in South America. About that nose: Tapirs use their prehensile nose trunk to grab plants and berries. And if they submerge under the surface of the water, some even use it as a snorkel.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pXHmKCIEWIiMRc.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SalisburyCathedral_EN-US5389036397_800x600.jpg" alt="Salisbury Cathedral with flock of grazing sheep"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Salisbury Cathedral with flock of grazing sheep</h2><p class="date">April 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We're in the English county of Wiltshire to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Salisbury Cathedral—the towering marvel of Early English Gothic design rising behind these contentedly grazing sheep. The massive church's first foundation stones were laid here in Salisbury—then called New Sarum—on April 28, 1220. The structure itself dates back even further, the bulk of it having been moved over a mile piece by piece from the former Roman stronghold of Old Sarum.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gAwpzBeRjqnJkm.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PalouseSpring_EN-US5686949948_800x600.jpg" alt="A tractor kicks up dust while tilling fields on the Palouse near Pullman"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">A tractor kicks up dust while tilling fields on the Palouse near Pullman</h2><p class="date">April 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest is an unusually hilly prairie that straddles the state line between Washington and Idaho. Farming seems an unlikely endeavor here, but the soil and weather patterns make it ideal for growing certain crops, especially wheat and lentils. This time of year, when the wheat and barley crops are young, the hills brighten to fresh shades of green.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lFDwnJjoStuTpj.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticRedpoll_EN-US5881398714_800x600.jpg" alt="Hoary redpoll nest in Lapland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hoary redpoll nest in Lapland</h2><p class="date">April 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">These colorful little eggs are the progeny of the hoary redpoll, also known as the Arctic redpoll because of its extreme northern habitat. This hardy finch spends much of its time, including breeding season, in the brushy tundra of the northern polar regions. Because of the extreme cold, the female will often line her nest with feathers, particularly white ptarmigan feathers, as these appear to be. Sighting a hoary redpoll is a rare treat. The bird doesn't exactly migrate, but in winter it will sometimes fly short distances farther south in search of food, so if you live in Minnesota, North Dakota, or Montana, you might get a peek at one on your bird feeder. You’ll recognize a hoary redpoll by its small yellow bill, red cap, dark face, and 'frosty' white underbody streaked with brown. Or listen for the 'chif chif chif' of its call.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/RPNLLUFNoSKprA.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GPS_EN-US1004072291_200x200.jpg" alt="The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jXFeZuEugKtyHp.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FataMorgana_EN-US6912310006_200x200.jpg" alt="Artist Laura Buckley with her mixed-media sculpture 'Fata Morgana"></div><div class="explore-label">Artist Laura Buckley with her mixed-media sculpture 'Fata Morgana</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/myqztuHHFaMAYr.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlgonquinGrouse_EN-US1800161492_200x200.jpg" alt="Ruffed grouse in Algonquin Provincial Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Ruffed grouse in Algonquin Provincial Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/TbBmGTtXPSwQNI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KauriTree_EN-US7535687512_200x200.jpg" alt="Te Matua Ngahere"></div><div class="explore-label">Te Matua Ngahere</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eKZNQWNiLHJDzt.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantoriniAerial_EN-US2668882319_200x200.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Santorini"></div><div class="explore-label">Aerial view of Santorini</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
