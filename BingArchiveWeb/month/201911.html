Since 2012, National Bison Day has been observed on the first Saturday of November to acknowledge the animal's cultural, historical, and economic significance—as well as its remarkable comeback. Bison were once plentiful in America. Tens of millions strong in the 1800s, they roamed in great herds, helping to diversify and maintain the prairie habitat. They also played an important spiritual role in Native American cultures. Settlement of the American West caused habitat loss and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether, until ranchers, conservationists, and politicians teamed up to save them. In 1907, 15 bison from the Bronx Zoo were shipped to a wildlife refuge in Oklahoma to revive the population. Fast forward to today, and around 20,000 bison roam on public lands in the United States. In 2016, President Obama named the bison the National Mammal of the United States.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qClGGwWGQmOoTw.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AbseilersBigBen_EN-US6976799855_800x600.jpg" alt="Workers cleaning the clock face of Big Ben in London"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Workers cleaning the clock face of Big Ben in London</h2><p class="date">November 3, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">While today's image may look like a scene from the 'Doctor Who' TV show, it actually shows workers maintaining Big Ben's clock face.

Thousands of people travel across mountains and through the Thar Desert to buy and sell livestock and enjoy the carnival-like atmosphere here. The fair offers visitors many diversions, but it's the camels who get top billing. Considered 'ships of the desert,' camels were domesticated by nomads thousands of years ago to carry goods across forbidding landscapes. When well fed and hydrated, a camel can travel great distances without needing water or food, sometimes for weeks. The humps on a camel's back serve a purpose: they're fatty deposits that act as a source of nutrition. Here, on the edge of the Thar Desert, the camel remains a mode of transport for nomads as well as a source for textiles, goods, and sustenance (did you know a camel's milk does not curdle in the desert heat?).

These threads are carefully extracted by hand with tweezers and dried before they're used for cooking. Each flower comes with just three threads, and it takes a lot of them—roughly 75,000 crocuses will yield just one pound of saffron.

That's when crowds of people clog the highways and skyways to get out of their respective towns and go on vacation. You, on the other hand, can relax. Unless your plans are to host a table full of hungry guests on Thanksgiving. In which case, may we suggest yoga and meditation tonight? (And turn off this electronic device before the flight attendant comes by again.)</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xcQRAgTQswhRVL.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WildTurkeys_EN-US9389941389_800x600.jpg" alt="Eastern wild turkeys strutting in Wisconsin"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Eastern wild turkeys strutting in Wisconsin</h2><p class="date">November 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The only difference between the wild turkeys in our photo today and the domestic turkeys many of us are preparing for the Thanksgiving meal is that domestic turkeys are raised on farms. Scientifically speaking, they’re the same species. The wild turkeys—like these two in Winter, Wisconsin—demonstrate how incredible these birds are in their natural environment. Adult turkeys have some 5,000 to 6,000 feathers, which work kind of like cat whiskers, helping the birds sense their environment. It’s the tom turkeys who have these large tail feather displays—they use them to attract hens. Wild turkeys don't fly far and don't migrate, but they are agile and can cover short distances quickly. They’re also highly adaptable to new environments, ranging throughout Mexico (where they originated) and the contiguous United States, and into several Canadian provinces as well.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eDqBBeyCFgYnpv.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AspenHiking_EN-US9667132806_800x600.jpg" alt="The Maroon Bells"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Maroon Bells</h2><p class="date">November 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Instead of rushing to the mall today for Black Friday deals, perhaps you could make it a Green Friday and find a treasure in a nearby park or wilderness like the Maroon Bells near Aspen, Colorado, pictured here. A few years ago, outdoor retailer REI made news by closing its doors on the biggest shopping day of the year and encouraging its employees and customers to 'Opt Outside' by spending time with their loved ones instead. While there is still no shortage of shopping options available to the intrepid Black Friday deal-hunter, a growing number of organizations have gotten behind this concept of Green Friday. And let's face it, after all that turkey and pie yesterday, you could probably use a nice walk. You can always shop online at work on Cyber Monday ;)</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/iREAmTXTPKhpLU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-US9766644565_800x600.jpg" alt="Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh</h2><p class="date">November 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Small Business Saturday started in 2010 to get shoppers out of the big box stores the day after Black Friday to support local retailers instead. The US is home to more than 30 million small businesses (500 employees or fewer), representing 47 percent of private sector employees. Of course, the concept of patronizing local merchants is nothing new. Here in Marrakesh, Morocco, souks (markets) like this one in Jemaa el-Fnaa Square have long been a big part of daily life, as well as major tourist attractions. During the day, musicians, dancers, and even snake charmers entertain shoppers as they search for crafts, clothing, and other goods. At night, the focus shifts to dining, with dozens of stalls offering different specialties and takes on traditional Moroccan food.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/iREAmTXTPKhpLU.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarrakechMarket_EN-US9766644565_200x200.jpg" alt="Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh"></div><div class="explore-label">Jemaa el-Fnaa Square in Marrakesh</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xcQRAgTQswhRVL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WildTurkeys_EN-US9389941389_200x200.jpg" alt="Eastern wild turkeys strutting in Wisconsin"></div><div class="explore-label">Eastern wild turkeys strutting in Wisconsin</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wvjSYyPqAOsoJL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrocusSativus_EN-US7229387698_200x200.jpg" alt="Saffron crocus flowers in Spain"></div><div class="explore-label">Saffron crocus flowers in Spain</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pFJjnvYNtbEGFj.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IchetuckneeRiver_EN-US7505288388_200x200.jpg" alt="Manatees in the Ichetucknee River in Florida"></div><div class="explore-label">Manatees in the Ichetucknee River in Florida</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/OmQkvPGKJDBmEk.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZionBirthday_EN-US2681531368_200x200.jpg" alt="Fall colors in Zion National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Fall colors in Zion National Park</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
