On May 1, Hawaii celebrates Lei Day, a tradition that honors culture, craftsmanship, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Since 1928, this Hawaiian tradition has been in full bloom, with leis—or garlands made of flowers, leaves, or shells—serving as symbols of connection. The idea for Lei Day came from poet Don Blanding, who suggested a holiday dedicated to Hawaii's iconic floral garlands. Local writer Grace Tower Warren gave it its slogan, 'May Day is Lei Day in Hawaii,' and the tradition quickly took root.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FaMBuTAOYxOKXA.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BrazilHeron_EN-US5602369723_800x600.jpg" alt="Striated heron on a Victoria water lily"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Striated heron on a Victoria water lily</h2><p class="date">May 2, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In the lush Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, a striated heron perches on a Victoria water lily leaf.

While it is only celebrated sporadically in Mexico, it has become a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture and heritage in the US, especially in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. This holiday is often mistaken for Mexican Independence Day, but that falls on September 16. Instead, Cinco de Mayo honors Mexico's fight against foreign rule and symbolizes resilience and unity. The battle itself was brief, lasting from daybreak to early evening, but the Mexican army, led by General Ignacio Zaragoza, managed to defeat a much larger and better-equipped French force. Today, Cinco de Mayo festivities feature parades, mariachi music, folk dancing, and delicious foods like tacos and mole poblano. Whether you're joining a festival or just enjoying a plate of Mexican cuisine, it's a great day to appreciate Mexico's rich history and traditions.

Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QSMbboFcCRTtpx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MiravetSpain_EN-US4967052818_800x600.jpg" alt="Miravet on the Ebro River"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Miravet on the Ebro River</h2><p class="date">May 29, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Some towns live in the present. Miravet in Spain politely declined. Clinging to a cliff above the River Ebro, this Catalan village offers a living glimpse into the Middle Ages. A castle keeps its perch, potters spin like it's the 1300s, and the local ferry still refuses to join the motor age. Welcome to the village where even the river seems too relaxed to rush. As Spain's longest river, the Ebro winds through tales of Iberians, Romans, Moors, and Knights Templar. Locals once relied on its waters for trade, transport, and even defense.

The steady ripple, the splash of trout, the distant laughter of hikers. That's the Little Pigeon River, threading its way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Long before tourists tubed it and fly fishers angled in it, this river was how people stayed afloat. The Cherokee tribe fished in it. Settlers built grist mills along it. Towns like Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge grew up next to it. Even the river's name is a nod to the past—the passenger pigeon, once common in the area, vanished by the early 1900s.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ayRfIoQtSStzGB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwedenReserve_EN-US8234763267_800x600.jpg" alt="Knuthöjdsmossen"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Knuthöjdsmossen</h2><p class="date">May 31, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Discover Knuthöjdsmossen, a nature reserve that covers almost 250 acres near the city of Hällefors, Sweden.
