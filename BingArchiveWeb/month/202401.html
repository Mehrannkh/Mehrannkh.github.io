It wasn't an easy vision to accomplish during the Great Depression, but the investment paid off as its construction created thousands of jobs and boosted growth.

Tumbling down in two stages from the mouth of the Schwarzbachfall cave, the 249-foot fall is a sight to behold in every season—whether it's framed by the lush greenery of spring or the icy embrace of winter. This region is known for its natural wonders and is also home to the world’s biggest ice cave, Eisriesenwelt, and the narrow Salzachöfen Gorge, considered to be the birthplace of white-water kayaking. Whether you are into hiking, photography, or just looking to spend some quality time in nature, this is a great Austrian destination.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vYevmMSwHLXhvD.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlbaceteSpain_EN-US7443919036_800x600.jpg" alt="Aýna"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Aýna</h2><p class="date">January 30, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Welcome to the tiny Spanish village of Aýna, in a steep valley carved by the River Mundo in the Sierra del Segura range. This part of the Castile-La Mancha region is sometimes called Manchegan Switzerland, thanks to those snow-capped peaks during the winter months. The steep, rocky terrain here means the villagers, of whom there are less than 1,000, cultivate the land on terraces dug into the mountainside. To see Aýna from this perspective, you'll need to visit the Mirador del Diablo, or Devil's Viewpoint, one of several viewing areas dotted around this picturesque valley.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EpzWdoKveLSYFB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZebraMother_EN-US7544209908_800x600.jpg" alt="Burchell's zebra mother and foal"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Burchell's zebra mother and foal</h2><p class="date">January 31, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's time for some black-and-white thinking. January 31 is International Zebra Day, celebrating the stripey creatures pictured here in Rietvlei Nature Reserve, South Africa. There are three species of zebra: plains, mountain, and Grévy's, and several subspecies. The mother and foal on our homepage are Burchell's zebras, a subspecies of the plains zebra. Found across eastern and southern Africa, zebras thrive in savannas, shrublands, woodlands, and mountain regions. They spend most of their time eating grasses, leaves, and shrubs, and can travel hundreds of miles in search of food and water. Sadly, all three species are under threat due to hunting and habitat destruction. International Zebra Day aims to raise awareness of conservation efforts, to help protect these striking creatures.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/VtZrAgJfqbjPHG.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IcelandBeach_EN-US2647667820_200x200.jpg" alt="Diamond Beach"></div><div class="explore-label">Diamond Beach</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ZmMxEWrabJxLEx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ParisBridge_EN-US1771484789_200x200.jpg" alt="Pont Alexandre III at twilight"></div><div class="explore-label">Pont Alexandre III at twilight</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EZcyGycaGsBaCd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzSunrise_EN-US6436233856_200x200.jpg" alt="Winter sunrise"></div><div class="explore-label">Winter sunrise</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cKEWRqalPSahWQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BodleianCeiling_EN-US7552379941_200x200.jpg" alt="Bodleian Library"></div><div class="explore-label">Bodleian Library</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/LxjwKqrBwOCBYX.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BukhansanSeoul_EN-US0422922586_200x200.jpg" alt="Bukhansan National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Bukhansan National Park</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
