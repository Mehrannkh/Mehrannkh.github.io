This rare 'streak,' as a group of tigers is called, is an exception. So much so, they became the subjects of a TV documentary called 'Girl Gang of Telia.' Today, on International Tiger Day, we're featuring these tigress sisters from the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in central India, a protected area that includes Tadoba National Park.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wTbVSYZAAFTmHV.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FiordlandRainforest_EN-US0539876428_800x600.jpg" alt="Rainforest hike near Milford Sound/Piopiotahi in New Zealand"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Rainforest hike near Milford Sound/Piopiotahi in New Zealand</h2><p class="date">July 30, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're taking a tramping trip to New Zealand's South Island to visit the place Rudyard Kipling once called the eighth wonder of the world, Milford Sound and its surrounding rainforest. Tramping, New Zealand-speak for hiking, is incredibly popular at Milford Sound. Nearly a million tourists visit the fjord every year, despite its somewhat remote location. Originally overlooked by European explorers, the area is now known for its beauty and abundance of wildlife. It's not uncommon for visitors to spot dolphins, humpback whales, and native Fiordland penguins.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/zELKEelJLxncAE.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NoctilucentClouds_EN-US0838966037_800x600.jpg" alt="Noctilucent clouds in Lithuania"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Noctilucent clouds in Lithuania</h2><p class="date">July 31, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's around this time of year when some lucky people get to witness these rare, wondrous clouds. Known as noctilucent, or 'night-shining,' clouds, they're the highest clouds in our sky and are only visible during summer. They're made up of icy dust glowing at the edge of space, roughly 50 miles above the planet's surface. The trick to seeing them is to gaze up into the sky at twilight, when sunlight is not reaching the Earth's surface, but is still shining through the high-altitude noctilucent clouds. These clouds occur more often at high latitudes but have been seen lower than 50° north and south.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/pOftKbIPXyAYLl.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NabateanTomb_EN-US4126304993_200x200.jpg" alt="Nabataean tomb in Mada'in Saleh (aka Hegra)"></div><div class="explore-label">Nabataean tomb in Mada'in Saleh (aka Hegra)</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vGtBmuthlZJPSl.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LongsPeak_EN-US4189093342_200x200.jpg" alt="Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/JhYqmVGUnmlWZc.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CoyoteButtes_EN-US2729289736_200x200.jpg" alt="The Wave sandstone formation in Coyote Buttes North"></div><div class="explore-label">The Wave sandstone formation in Coyote Buttes North</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/uSHwfPHKYPixpC.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FoxgloveHawkmoth_EN-US4340017481_200x200.jpg" alt="Elephant hawk-moth on foxglove flower"></div><div class="explore-label">Elephant hawk-moth on foxglove flower</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/emIZMwVgAPMACz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MoonPhases_EN-US3514261526_200x200.jpg" alt="Composite photo showing the phases of the moon"></div><div class="explore-label">Composite photo showing the phases of the moon</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
