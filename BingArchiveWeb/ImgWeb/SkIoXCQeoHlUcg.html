It might seem odd to sing the praises of rock, but think about it. Rocks have been with humankind since the beginning. From tools to housing to weapons, they've been key to our survival. A period of our history was so reliant on rocks that it will be forever known as the Stone Age. We would not be where we are today without the many minerals found on our planet, so rock on!<br><br>To celebrate, we're going to focus on one marvelous rock in particular: basalt, the most abundant volcanic rock on Earth. Here at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, there are roughly 40,000 interlocking hexagonal columns of basalt that were formed after an ancient eruption. Celtic legends tell different stories about the origins of the rock formation. One suggests that it was built as a battleground for two giants, Ireland's Fionn mac Cumhaill (aka Finn MacCool) and Scotland's Benandonner. Another legend claims that mac Cumhaill built the causeway to cross the North Channel to meet a Scottish lover. However it came to be, the Giant's Causeway is revered today as one of the United Kingdom's greatest natural wonders and is among the most popular tourist spots in Northern Ireland.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202207.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./XVxUNEIHoZwJUU.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./zswtinGsPoWZbx.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
