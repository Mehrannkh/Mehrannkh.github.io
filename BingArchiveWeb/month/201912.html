Exit Glacier is known for being one of the most visited of Alaska's glaciers, likely because it’s accessible via the Seward Highway.

Although they are known for being large, tough animals, rhinos are easily poached during their daily visits to the watering hole. Southern white rhinos now thrive in protected sanctuaries like the Amakhala Game Reserve. But the northern white rhino subspecies is believed to be extinct in the wild with only a few captive individuals remaining.

The construction displaced thousands of black residents from their homes, threatening the livelihood of the community.

Bad weather neutralized Allied air superiority and over the first few days, the Nazi offensive produced a 'bulge' in the Allies' defensive line west into Belgium. Desperate to hold the line, US General Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to defend the strategically important crossroads in Bastogne. The town was surrounded for nearly 10 days by German forces, but the Airborne held out. In fact, a German demand for Allied surrender was rejected with a single word: 'NUTS' (a bit of 1940s American slang that needed to be explained to the Nazi officers).

Thomas Edison created the first practical incandescent lights and used them to decorate his Menlo Park laboratory for Christmas in 1880. Then three years later, the vice president of Edison's company, Edward H. Johnson, had Christmas tree bulbs especially made, which he used to decorate the tree in his New York City home. Nevertheless, electric lights didn’t catch on as a holiday decoration among the general public until 1895, when President Grover Cleveland asked that the White House Christmas tree be illuminated by hundreds of multicolored electric bulbs.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ElpABayrRSisZA.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SloveniaAlps_EN-US3700970842_800x600.jpg" alt="The Church of St. Thomas above the village of Praprotno"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Church of St. Thomas above the village of Praprotno</h2><p class="date">December 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're featuring an image of the Slovenian village of Praprotno and its Church of St. Thomas for the country's Independence and Unity Day.

Whenever temps drop low enough, many locals take to the ice and skate away on a complex network of canals. These waterways were built centuries ago—along with pumps, dikes, and the windmills pictured here—to protect the village of Kinderdijk by diverting water from the land. It's an important job, since Kinderdijk, like much of the Netherlands, lies below sea level and flooding is a major problem. Nowadays a modern water management system with multiple pumping stations does the work, and the windmills are left with a new job–to maintain an iconic Dutch scene. In 1997, the Kinderdijk windmills were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/WjSTOiAIccfngh.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TrumpeterWinter_EN-US3945298100_800x600.jpg" alt="Trumpeter swans at Kelly Warm Springs"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Trumpeter swans at Kelly Warm Springs</h2><p class="date">December 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Native to North America, trumpeter swans live near rivers, lakes, and coastal byways in northern and western US states in the lower 48, as well as in Canada and Alaska. Depending on where they live, these swans are either resident birds or medium-range migrators. What they all require, though, is year-round access to open water, since their diet consists almost entirely of aquatic plants. That may be why the swans in this image are drawn to the waters of Kelly Warm Springs in Wyoming, which won't freeze even as snow lines the banks.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nEtRQZjiilrUWm.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.InnsbruckSkiJump_EN-US4058119779_800x600.jpg" alt="German ski jumper Markus Eisenbichler competing in the Four Hills Tournament"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">German ski jumper Markus Eisenbichler competing in the Four Hills Tournament</h2><p class="date">December 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're featuring the Four Hills Tournament, a set of four ski jump events that starts today.

Here, near Tucson, Arizona, the Sonoran Desert stays warm year-round. In this photo, we're looking at a 'sky island'—an isolated, high-elevation woodland surrounded by radically different lowland environments. In this case, the desert land at the base of the mountain is peppered with saguaros—a stately cactus recognized for its long arms. The snow-capped Santa Catalina Mountains in the distance are part of the Madrean Sky Islands and are home to Mount Lemmon Ski Valley, which is the southernmost ski destination in the US. The ski area covers the slopes of Mount Lemmon, which reaches an elevation of about 9,100 feet at the summit and can receive around 180 inches of snow annually.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/djEDPMSgZFHGWA.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NYEBacknang_EN-US4252840326_800x600.jpg" alt="Fireworks for New Year's Eve in Backnang"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Fireworks for New Year's Eve in Backnang</h2><p class="date">December 31, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Backnang, the city celebrating the new year in this photo, is in Germany's Baden region.
