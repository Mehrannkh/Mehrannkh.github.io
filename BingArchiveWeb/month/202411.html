These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing, and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers, and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park, featured in today's image.

The tradition dates back to English colonists who celebrated the first Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1621. Their treacherous journey from England the year before and their first winter claimed half of the colonists, and the rest might have died too if not for the generosity of the Wampanoag people.

The story of this 'Wonder of the West' goes back to the early 8th century, when Archangel Michael was said to have appeared to the bishop of Avranches in a vision.

Scotland's national day is a public holiday there—though not everyone takes the day off. A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew—also the patron saint of several other countries including Greece, Barbados, Romania, and Ukraine—was one of the 12 apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalized in the country's flag, a white saltire on a blue background, said to represent the cross on which he was martyred.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/BTGpMFdmYNQqii.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YucatanBiosphere_EN-US4019968428_200x200.jpg" alt="Caribbean flamingo nests"></div><div class="explore-label">Caribbean flamingo nests</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DjNcZFESCyHOnA.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HovenweepRuins_EN-US3883549583_200x200.jpg" alt="Pueblo ruins"></div><div class="explore-label">Pueblo ruins</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ZKJJWechwDzVtX.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZafraCastle_EN-US5032917939_200x200.jpg" alt="Castle of Zafra"></div><div class="explore-label">Castle of Zafra</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tYCVBQgzScgEiY.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KelpForest_EN-US4745308334_200x200.jpg" alt="California sea lion in a forest of giant kelp"></div><div class="explore-label">California sea lion in a forest of giant kelp</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/KwcgjlSgCefMWz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SonomaCoast_EN-US5218026576_200x200.jpg" alt="Sonoma Coast State Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Sonoma Coast State Park</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
