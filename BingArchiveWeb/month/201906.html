The rail-to-trail movement began in the 1960s when many railroad tracks began to be removed and people noted that the relatively flat rail corridors were perfect for hiking and biking trails.

Knowing that the ability to land huge numbers of men, vehicles, and supplies would be crucial to the Allies’ success in the invasion of Normandy, Winston Churchill challenged his forces to come up with artificial harbors that could be towed into place and operational within days of the initial landings.Over 40,000 men were involved in the creation of two harbors that were installed at Omaha and Gold Beaches beginning on June 9, 1944, and which were completed just six days later.  The harbors included breakwaters comprising sunken decommissioned ships, pre-built concrete caissons, 33 jetties, and over 10 miles of roadways. A violent storm on June 19 destroyed the harbor at Omaha Beach, but Mulberry B, at Arromanches, survived and by the time it was abandoned six months later it had landed 2.5 million men, 500,000 vehicles, and 4 million tons of supplies into northern France.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ovmSRVNQEHpKhq.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Biorocks_EN-US2105531029_800x600.jpg" alt="Biorock artificial reef off the Gili Islands"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Biorock artificial reef off the Gili Islands</h2><p class="date">June 8, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Humans have been trying to construct artificial coral reefs since at least the 1950s, with only marginal success. But in 1979, German scientist and inventor Wolf Hilbertz created ‘Biorock,’ also known as ‘Seacrete.’ Hilbertz found that by directing a low-voltage charge to a metal frame submerged in seawater, calcium and other minerals in the water would build up on the frame. This mineral coating is so similar to the mineral composition of natural reef substrate that it creates a good habitat for the growth of corals. After the minerals have begun to coat the surface, divers transplant coral fragments from other reefs, attaching them to the structure’s frame. These coral pieces begin to bond to the accreted mineral substrate and start to grow, typically faster than in natural environments. Eventually the reef looks and functions like a natural reef ecosystem rather than an artificial one.The story of Biorock is a good example of how technology and human innovation are important parts of the conservation movement, especially where Earth’s oceans are concerned. More than 70 percent of our planet’s surface is covered by oceans, and those oceans contain 97 percent of Earth’s water. That’s why ocean health is a global concern. It’s also the motivation behind World Oceans Day, celebrated every June 8. We’re celebrating with this photo of a Biorock reef off the Gili Islands in Indonesia.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HFnJHDDowmRIcs.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrownFountain_EN-US2176724041_800x600.jpg" alt="Crown Fountain by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Crown Fountain by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa</h2><p class="date">June 9, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Welcome to Chicago, the undisputed home of the blues. If you’re a fan of blues music, make your way here to Millennium Park this weekend for the 36th annual Chicago Blues Festival. Blues music is considered one of America’s greatest contributions to world culture and the progenitor of jazz, R&B, and rock & roll.During the Great Migration (1910-1970), over half a million African Americans followed the Illinois Central Railroad from the Deep South up to that land of opportunity, Chicago. Among those making that trip was a veritable Mount Rushmore of blues greats including Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Dixon, Little Walter, and Buddy Guy. And they all brought that propulsive electrified country style that makes Chicago blues so distinctive. So, put on your walkin’ shoes, get your mojo working, and catch a spoonful of that smokestack lightning at the Chicago Blues Festival.

Numbers help tell the story of this extraordinary place: At more than 2.1 million square miles, the Amazon accounts for half of Earth’s remaining tropical rainforests. And a fifth of the world’s fresh water flows through this river basin. Perhaps a tenth of the planet’s known species call it home, many of which have yet to be identified—that’s trees, plants, fish, mammals, and a third of Earth’s bird species. Now take a deep breath. The ‘Lungs of the World’ produces 20 percent of Earth’s oxygen, while storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide, earning it an all-star ‘carbon sink’ status.Why’s it called the Amazon? Spanish explorer and conquistador Francisco de Orellana gave it that name after encountering indigenous women of the Pira-tapuya tribe who fought alongside men. The women warriors of the region reminded Orellana of the Amazons of Greek mythology. Today, the Amazon rainforest still sounds almost mythologically powerful—and it is. Yet, all rainforests are fragile biosystems. Worldwide, we lose swaths of these precious environments to agriculture and mining every day. However, the pace of deforestation is slowing as farming methods improve and advocacy efforts build awareness around these rich bio-diverse tropical rainforests.

Later, more scientific surveys proved this estimate to be significantly inflated, but Sutherland Falls is still 1,900 feet tall, which is plenty high in our book.It’s probably pretty cold out in the Fiordland wilderness today, as the Southern Hemisphere is in the midst of winter. While the Northern Hemisphere has tilted toward the sun, giving us the long, warm days of summer, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away, so the days are short and nights are cold.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gtgqKQCIJBocKQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GlastonburyTor_EN-US5410294627_800x600.jpg" alt="Glastonbury Tor and St. Michael's Tower in England for the start of the Glastonbury Festival"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Glastonbury Tor and St. Michael's Tower in England for the start of the Glastonbury Festival</h2><p class="date">June 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Greetings from Glastonbury Tor and St. Michael's Tower in Somerset county of South West England.  The tor (a Celtic word for an isolated hill) is often mentioned in Celtic mythology, and some believe it to be the site of Avalon, a mythical island central to legends of King Arthur. Glastonbury Tor has other enduring spiritual associations as well, particularly to various neopagan beliefs. Archaeological evidence suggests that several buildings have been constructed at the top of the hill over many centuries, but all that remains today is the roofless tower of St. Michael’s Church, built in the 1300s.Glastonbury Tor may dominate the surrounding coastal plain, but it isn't visible from the nearby Glastonbury Festival, which begins today and runs through Sunday, June 30. Since 1970, music fans have turned the Glastonbury area into an outdoor bacchanalian summer retreat as they converge on the area to watch some of the world's most popular pop and rock musicians perform live at the festival. Most summers, the farmland around the village of Pilton—including festival-creator Michael Eavis' Worthy Farm—is transformed into the largest greenfield festival in the world, with more than 100,000 people attending and camping in the area. In an homage to the area’s most enduring feature, the festival's official artwork this year is a representation of Glastonbury Tor and its tower under a full moon, surrounded by red clouds.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/buXSEUuLCDLHog.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RootBridge_EN-US5546496960_800x600.jpg" alt="Living root bridge in Meghalaya"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Living root bridge in Meghalaya</h2><p class="date">June 27, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Living root bridges like this can be found in the tropical rainforests of Meghalaya, a state in northeast India that is among the wettest places on Earth. The gentle waterways that flow through the region’s valleys become gushing torrents during the summer monsoon season and will wash away traditional bamboo bridges. So, generations of indigenous Khasi people have devised a way of building root bridges by shaping living trees, like this one near the village of Mawsynram.It works like this: Rubber fig trees are planted or located on opposite riverbanks. As the trees' above-ground roots grow, the Khasi will guide them across the water, sometimes with the support of temporary scaffolding like bamboo. After years of tending, the roots will eventually join and take hold of each other, forming a living suspension bridge that provides safe passage over the swollen river. The innovation has proved critical to the Khasi people. In this environment, bridges made from harvested materials would quickly rot and fall apart, leaving villages cut off and isolated. Building a living root bridge requires patience, though. It takes about 15 to 30 years to grow one sturdy enough to support humans. But the investment pays off. As these bridges age, they get stronger. Some are 100 feet long and can hold over 50 people.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/itbfMNpXHJXnAi.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Montreux_EN-US5652122855_800x600.jpg" alt="Montreux and Lake Geneva in Switzerland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Montreux and Lake Geneva in Switzerland</h2><p class="date">June 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We’re looking at Montreux, Switzerland, where the Montreux Jazz Festival begins today. Despite its name, the festival isn't just about jazz. It highlights different styles of music across multiple venues over two weeks. This year's lineup includes three farewell-tour stops (Elton John, Anita Baker, Joan Baez) and big names in jazz (Chick Corea, Bobby McFerrin), as well as young artists representing a variety of genres. The festival began in 1967 at the original Montreux Casino, which famously burned down during a December 1971 Frank Zappa performance. The fire was memorialized by Deep Purple in their hit 'Smoke on the Water.' A monument commemorating the band and their song can be found next to the rebuilt casino.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gOqSDTniFvpnBK.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BurrowingOwlet_EN-US5825222069_800x600.jpg" alt="Burrowing owlet posing in Cape Coral"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Burrowing owlet posing in Cape Coral</h2><p class="date">June 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Here on the green grass of Cape Coral, Florida, this owl looks ready for his closeup, and ready for National Camera Day. June 29 commemorates photographs, the camera, and their invention. The history of the camera goes all the way back to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, who used pinhole cameras (camera obscuras), similar to what you might use to view a solar eclipse. The camera obscura could project an image but didn’t leave a lasting one.In the 1800s, several inventors made advances toward producing an image on a piece of paper or sensitized plate. They also experimented with various lenses. In 1884, George Eastman patented the first film in rolls, and a few years later introduced the Kodak Black camera. These days, of course, just about everyone carries around a digital camera in their phone, documenting everything from major life events to their latest sandwich. So get in the spirit of the day and snap a selfie, a picture of your pet, or anything for National Camera Day.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/kSHcATwcIipxDo.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Pride2019_EN-US5957966998_800x600.jpg" alt="San Francisco City Hall lit with rainbow lights for Pride"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">San Francisco City Hall lit with rainbow lights for Pride</h2><p class="date">June 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We’re celebrating Pride weekend with a view onto a Beaux-Arts gem that has a prominent place in the history of gay rights and culture. Even the city of San Francisco itself has played an outsized role in fostering gay pride, community, and visibility. It’s a legacy that can be traced along the timeline of the city’s many firsts. The San Francisco Bay Area held one of the first Pride parades after the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, the event that sparked the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQI+ civil rights. This is just part of the heritage that will be celebrated at San Francisco’s Pride this weekend, where people will be marking the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. A big parade is planned with vibrant displays that will decorate Market Street, continuing all the way to the Golden Gate City’s Civic Center.Fifty years after the Stonewall riots, so much progress has been made in the fight for LGBTQI+ civil rights, and so much work remains. This time of year is when people in cities and towns around the world celebrate Pride. Most large cities hold Pride parades at the end of June—in fact, São Paulo, Brazil, hosted what is thought to be the largest parade; its organizers estimated in 2017 that 5 million came to their Pride event.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/itbfMNpXHJXnAi.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Montreux_EN-US5652122855_200x200.jpg" alt="Montreux and Lake Geneva in Switzerland"></div><div class="explore-label">Montreux and Lake Geneva in Switzerland</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HFnJHDDowmRIcs.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrownFountain_EN-US2176724041_200x200.jpg" alt="Crown Fountain by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa"></div><div class="explore-label">Crown Fountain by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ovmSRVNQEHpKhq.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Biorocks_EN-US2105531029_200x200.jpg" alt="Biorock artificial reef off the Gili Islands"></div><div class="explore-label">Biorock artificial reef off the Gili Islands</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/TEQsPbsHVCsyib.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CrackingArt_EN-US2386428540_200x200.jpg" alt="Cracking Art installation at Le Mans Cathedral in 2015"></div><div class="explore-label">Cracking Art installation at Le Mans Cathedral in 2015</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gVCypHiBRuYXit.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PontadaPiedade_EN-US2259458869_200x200.jpg" alt="Ponta da Piedade rock formations off the coast of Algarve"></div><div class="explore-label">Ponta da Piedade rock formations off the coast of Algarve</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
