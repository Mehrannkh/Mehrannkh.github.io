We're in a Scottish village now known as New Abbey, about 8 miles south of Dumfries. We've stepped inside the ruins of Sweetheart Abbey, a 13th-century testament to the love between a husband and wife. Founded in 1273 by 'lady of substance' Dervorguilla of Galloway, the abbey was constructed solely to commemorate her love for English nobleman John de Balliol upon his death in 1268.<br><br>Her devotion didn't end there, though. It's said she had his heart embalmed and placed in an ivory casket bound with silver. She then carried it with her everywhere she traveled for the rest of her life. Dervorguilla and the heart were eventually laid to rest alongside John at the abbey when she passed in 1290. As time progressed, sadly, the lovers' graves were lost to war.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202206.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./GDHUsufoNxetdG.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./BHKhCikxPPyBSd.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
