Leis are garlands crafted from flowers, leaves, and even shells, carrying significant cultural importance in Hawaiian culture. Leis were brought by the Polynesians as they migrated eastward through the Pacific Islands before reaching Hawaii between 1000 and 1200 CE. They represent love, respect, and the ever-present aloha spirit, described as 'the coordination of mind and heart within each person.' Lei Day is an all-day fiesta that includes parades, pageants, lei-making contests, hula dances, and feasts.

Brittlebushes produce bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding splashes of color to the desert landscape. Another drought-loving desert flora is the saguaro cactus, which can live for over 150 years and grow up to 40 feet tall.

It would be another 13 years before enough land was acquired to make the park a reality but today, it encapsulates the largest subtropical wilderness in the US. Spanning more than 1.5 million acres, the park is a lifeline to 36 federally protected and endangered wildlife species, from the gentle manatee to the stealthy Florida panther. Here, the air thrums with the calls of over 350 bird species like limpkins and snail kites, while the waters teem with life including hundreds of species of fish, sea turtles, and American crocodiles. Beyond its biodiversity, the park is celebrated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, an International Biosphere Reserve, and a Wetland of International Importance. Here's to Everglades National Park—may it continue to inspire wonder, curiosity, and appreciation for the wild world around us.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tTOxfOCRDNfjOP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YorkshireDalesNP_EN-US6104560581_800x600.jpg" alt="Gunnerside"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Gunnerside</h2><p class="date">May 31, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In Yorkshire Dales National Park, the ancient village of Gunnerside is brimming with English charm and history. Picture yourself strolling through its narrow lanes, surrounded by rolling hills, lush pastures, and stone cottages, with the roar of the Swale River your only soundtrack. Designated in 1954, the national park is spread across 841 square miles, and there are over 1,000 farms in this area. One of the area's most distinctive features are its dry stone walls; built without any kind of mortar, they can last hundreds of years. There are thought to be over 5,000 miles of these walls in the Dales.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/xhgeWPUrGBOVvd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlueCityIndia_EN-US1593809891_200x200.jpg" alt="The Blue City of Jodhpur"></div><div class="explore-label">The Blue City of Jodhpur</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/LKwCjLnWwNlEHQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TexasIndigoBunting_EN-US0916417036_200x200.jpg" alt="An indigo bunting perched on a branch"></div><div class="explore-label">An indigo bunting perched on a branch</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/womHKMiXcEGlcQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TarangireElephants_EN-US8865263185_200x200.jpg" alt="A family of African elephants in Tarangire National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">A family of African elephants in Tarangire National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/izaHVwvmDeVBQY.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MethowWildflowers_EN-US4937353385_200x200.jpg" alt="Balsamroot and lupines"></div><div class="explore-label">Balsamroot and lupines</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mTUdyooeICxMsF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OrdesaNationalPark_EN-US4779461538_200x200.jpg" alt="Añisclo Canyon"></div><div class="explore-label">Añisclo Canyon</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
