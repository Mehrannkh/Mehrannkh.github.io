The park contains a rich array of biodiversity, important historic sites of Native Hawaiians, and the glowing stars of the show—two of the world's most active volcanos, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea.The massive Mauna Loa rises 56,000 feet from the sea floor, which means it's more than twice as tall as Everest. Kīlauea made headlines in 2018 for oozing lava for four months straight. This eruption destroyed over 700 homes and damaged roadways, park trails, buildings, and other infrastructure.

By the 1930s, they had completely disappeared from the wild in Canada.That changed in the '90s, when programs to reintroduce the swift fox in Alberta and Saskatchewan began to see some success. Over the next decade, the small population became self-sustaining and its listing was upgraded from extirpated to endangered in Canada.

He sailed five ships and a crew of more than 230 men down the Guadalquivir, the river in today's image. Magellan wouldn’t have seen this incarnation of Seville’s Triana Bridge, though. It was built more than three centuries after the expedition's return to the city in 1522. While successful in finding a western route to the Pacific Ocean and returning with valuable spices, the feat came at great cost. Only one ship, under the command of Juan Sebastián Elcano, and 17 other crew members completed the global circumnavigation, returning to Spain three years after setting off. Magellan wasn’t among them. He was killed on April 27, 1521, at the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines.Seville and other Andalusian cities will celebrate these milestone anniversaries as part of the 'V Centenario.'

In 1883, Teddy Roosevelt, then a New York State assemblyman, traveled to the North Dakota Badlands to hunt bison. During this trip, Roosevelt fell in love with the cowboy lifestyle and the freedom he experienced. Before heading back east, he became part owner of the Maltese Cross Ranch. A year later he was back in North Dakota and had built Elkhorn Ranch. Life in the West inspired Roosevelt, who began writing books and articles about it. He would go on to establish six national parks and 18 national monuments, greatly increasing the size of the National Park System.At Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the only US national park named after a person, you can see some of the places that helped inspire Roosevelt's conservation efforts. In the park's Elkhorn Ranch Unit, the location of his 'home ranch,' you can experience the same remoteness that he craved. At the South Unit Visitor Center you can see the cabin he used as his home during his first trips to the Badlands, now restored to its original state.

And with that, Skookum Jim Mason (aka Keish) and his American brother-in-law George Carmack set in motion the Klondike Gold Rush—the richest gold strike in North American history. Because of the remoteness of the find, it would be over 11 months before the rest of the world found out. And it did so in the most dramatic fashion, when the steamers Portland and Excelsior pulled into the harbors of Seattle and San Francisco respectively carrying over one ton of gold (worth more than $1 billion in today's dollars).The news reached the rest of the United States and Canada during a prolonged economic depression, which may help to explain why over 100,000 people (including the mayor of Seattle) quit their jobs and set out for the Yukon with dreams of striking pay dirt. But the trip was harrowing and arduous, and fewer than half of those who set out for the Klondike wound up making it there. Nevertheless, the sudden influx of those who did complete the journey briefly turned Dawson City into the second largest city in Canada...and certainly the most expensive. Eggs cost $3 apiece (the equivalent of $81 today) and salt was literally worth its weight in gold. In the saloons of the boom town, a profit could be made by simply sweeping the floor and collecting spilled gold dust. Most who came lost everything.

Around the world, there are over 20,000 species of bees, which include solitary bees, bumblebees, and honey bees. Of these, only honey bees make honey, but all these industrious insects benefit humans by pollinating roughly a third of the crops we eat. Honey bees do most of the heavy lifting. In the US alone, each year domesticated honey bees pollinate about $20 billion worth of crops such as almonds, watermelons, blueberries, and more.Unfortunately, populations of bees and other insects have declined from historic levels due to a variety of factors, such as parasites, pathogens, pesticides, and the loss of habitat.

At the young age of 26, Álvaro Siza designed these Piscinas das Marés (Pools on the Beach). His creation has become a Portuguese national landmark and is praised for the way the pools blend into the landscape from some perspectives, and show a harmonious blend of nature and artificiality from others. The design respectfully floats the pools between the soft sands of the beach and the rocky outcrops that have been here long before 1966, when the project was completed. The shapes of the pools simultaneously follow and oppose the natural lines of the terrain that surround them, a masterful balance that foregrounds the beauty of each, as well as the entirety of the scene Álvaro Siza has helped to set.Of course, pools are for swimming, and locals and visitors flock to Leça da Palmeira for summer fun. The larger saltwater pool is designated for adults and sits close to the ocean. The other pool is located more inland and has an entrance that is fairly low to the ground—a lighthearted signal that this is where young kids can swim. Álvaro Siza built changing rooms and a café here too, with low-walled pathways that are carefully positioned to not only leave the views of the coastline  undisturbed, but they follow the right angles to enhance what you see, whether you are headed to grab a bite or take a swim.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YgzUlqLaWdxtmm.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReplicaFlyer_EN-US6328727049_800x600.jpg" alt="Replica of the Wright Flyer undergoing aerodynamic tests at NASA's Langley Research Center"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Replica of the Wright Flyer undergoing aerodynamic tests at NASA's Langley Research Center</h2><p class="date">August 19, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">For National Aviation Day, we’re highlighting a rare view from inside a wind tunnel at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Virginia.

The great number of animals makes this phenomenon one of the largest land migrations on Earth, often called the ‘world cup of wildlife.’</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pjVxXRcCyRrTuv.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DubaiFountain_EN-US6547955834_800x600.jpg" alt="The Dubai Fountain in Burj Lake"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Dubai Fountain in Burj Lake</h2><p class="date">August 22, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">With the 2009 opening of the Dubai Fountain, featured in today's image, the city of Dubai claimed another record for the books—'world's tallest performing fountain.’ It's located appropriately enough at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest building. Designed by the same company that created the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, everything about the Dubai Fountain is impressive. Over 900 feet long and located in the 30-acre Burj Lake, the fountain has more than 6,600 lights and 75 color projectors. These are used to create over 1,000 different 'water expressions' and provide a rainbow of colors, all perfectly choreographed to a carefully crafted musical playlist.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/SJYxZVDvNHcOmD.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FarmlandLandscape_EN-US6661316442_800x600.jpg" alt="Farmland in Washington state's Palouse region"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Farmland in Washington state's Palouse region</h2><p class="date">August 23, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest is an unusually hilly prairie that straddles the state line between Washington and Idaho. Farming seems an unlikely endeavor here, but the soil and weather patterns make it ideal for growing certain crops. This time of year, the soft white wheat harvest is on, as the grain turns from green to gold, and for the farmers, from harvest to profit. Earlier in the summer, farmers reap the other key crop of the Palouse, lentils. Before Europeans and early US settlers arrived, the Palouse was occupied by the Nez Perce people, who bred and raised horses with spotted coats—a breed that would eventually come to be known as 'appaloosas'—a gradual permutation of the name 'Palouse.'</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jBZAvKyBBcWpJW.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AugustBears_EN-US6742425682_800x600.jpg" alt="Brown bears in Katmai National Park and Preserve"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Brown bears in Katmai National Park and Preserve</h2><p class="date">August 24, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">If you want to see a brown bear in the wild—and from a safe distance—this is a good time to head to Katmai National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska. The 4.1-million-acre park is home to about 2,200 brown bears, the largest population of protected brown bears on the continent. In summer and early fall, these normally solitary creatures congregate and wade into rivers and streams to feast on salmon returning home to spawn. One of the best spots for bear watching is Brooks Camp, which offers three platforms built just for this purpose. But it takes some effort to get there—the park is only accessible by plane or boat.So, are these brown bears or grizzlies? That's complicated. In North America, there are several subspecies of brown bears that vary in size and coloring, though they're all members of the same species (Ursus arctos), which can also be found in parts of Europe and Asia. It’s the most widely distributed bear species in the world.  'Grizzly' tends to refer to brown bears that live in the interior of Alaska, Canada, and parts of the lower 48 states. When people refer to ‘brown bears,’ they’re generally talking about bears like these two, which are bigger than most ‘grizzlies’ and roam the coastal areas of Alaska. They go by several names: Alaskan brown bears, coastal brown bears, peninsula brown bears, and peninsula grizzlies. Kodiak bears, which live on nearby Kodiak Island, are considered the largest of all the brown bear subspecies.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ragltpLEuyhTgQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlackRockCity_EN-US6804847775_800x600.jpg" alt="Satellite image of the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Satellite image of the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City</h2><p class="date">August 25, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we’re viewing North America’s largest arts and music festival—dust free—from a satellite lens. Welcome to Black Rock City, the pop-up home of Burning Man, a raucous event that takes place in late summer each year on the sun-scorched alkali flats of Nevada’s Black Rock Desert. It’s an unusual set-up, a counterculture mecca where gifts reign supreme and money has no value.Festival goers are called Burners in honor of the massive wooden effigy of a man they build each year, only to be set ablaze on the penultimate eve of the event. The 70,000 attendees may come as individuals or entire communities. Many plan months in advance to construct grandiose installations, fantastical floats, art cars, and other creative expressions that defy the logistical constraints of the harsh desert landscape. To do this they must pack in everything they’ll need for nine days, with the full knowledge that it must all be packed back out again. Any litter left behind is considered MOOP (Matter Out of Place), so glitter and other things difficult to retrieve from the desert floor are forbidden. Once inside, goods and services can’t be bought; however, volunteering and gifting are expected. Part of the mission behind Burning Man is to build a creative and connected community.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/fCPYOzhILXezEv.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.InteriorRoyalAlbertHall_EN-US6870096316_800x600.jpg" alt="Royal Albert Hall during the annual BBC Proms festival in London"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Royal Albert Hall during the annual BBC Proms festival in London</h2><p class="date">August 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We're looking at the West-Eastern Divan youth orchestra rehearsing for a performance in the BBC Proms. The Proms (short for promenade concerts) is an annual music festival held in London over eight weeks from July into September. The first Proms took place on August 10, 1895, in the Queen’s Hall in Langham Place, London. After the Queen's Hall was destroyed by a bomb during the Blitz, the Proms moved here to the Royal Albert Hall in 1941. This year marks the 125th festival and includes 150 concerts and educational events. While the focus is on classical music, the Proms in the Park event closes out the season in nearby Hyde Park with performances from Barry Manilow, Chrissie Hynde, and other pop artists.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lwEzfjPsFXDzkc.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CorsiniGardens_EN-US7010199576_800x600.jpg" alt="The Garden of the Palazzo Corsini al Prato in Florence"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Garden of the Palazzo Corsini al Prato in Florence</h2><p class="date">August 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Because it’s hidden just beyond the walls of the Palazzo Corsini al Prato, the Corsini Garden is never seen by many of the tourists who visit the grand palace.

The festival features a 'new generation' of musical talent from around the world performing in a different musical genre each night.

Bruce Springsteen has played here regularly since the 1970s, performing everywhere from the Stone Pony, an iconic music venue, to a benefit show at Asbury Lanes, a bowling alley that was in dire need of sprucing up. Springsteen, who grew up near this stretch of the Jersey Shore, clearly finds Asbury Park special—the name of his 1973 album inspired our title for today’s homepage image. But the seaside resort’s rich musical history predates the Boss—a building boom in the 1920s brought sounds of jazz, gospel, and rhythm and blues to the many clubs here. Musicians Arthur Pryor, Count Basie, and many others developed strong ties to Asbury Park and helped establish its reputation as a showcase for great American music.The tradition continues today with a ‘Jams on the Sand’ summer concert series, which ends this evening, and plenty of other events around town. Whether sunning at North Beach or taking in a show, be sure not to miss other attractions like the famed boardwalk. There’s also the Carousel House, a renovated Beaux-Arts landmark.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/kioVTCPGOXPpkP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HardeeCoFair_EN-US1477332511_800x600.jpg" alt="Hardee County Fair in Wauchula"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hardee County Fair in Wauchula</h2><p class="date">August 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">If it's summer, there's a fair going on somewhere. Looking at this photo, you can practically smell the cotton candy, hear the sonic blend of rides, carnival games, and music, and taste the sugary fried food (and feel your arteries clogging). Smaller fairs like this one in Hardee County, Florida, lead up to larger state fairs in most areas. August is the most popular month for state fairs, though a handful are in July, and some southern states have them during cooler months. Fairs weren't always about rides and outrageously fattening foods, though. Beginning with the first state fair in Syracuse, New York, back in 1841, and long before anyone figured out how to fry a stick of butter, there were celebrations of agriculture and livestock, and those traditions continue. So, when you hit your local fair, don't forget to check out the giant vegetables and costumed llamas before you get in line for the tilt-a-whirl or a deep-fried Snickers wrapped in bacon.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hyQqvytNchOCcJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Slackers_EN-US7258381769_800x600.jpg" alt="Slacklining between giant boulders in Bishop"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Slacklining between giant boulders in Bishop</h2><p class="date">August 31, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Our homepage today shows two climbers slacklining between boulders near Bishop, California. Look closely and you’ll see something very similar to tightrope walking: The slackliners anchor a thin strip of webbing between two points and then walk across (very carefully, of course). Bishop is near the Sierra Nevada and is a popular destination for climbers interested in both slacklining and bouldering. What's bouldering? That's rock climbing without ropes or harnesses. Instead, climbers simply shimmy up rocky crags and free-standing boulders—but no higher than 20 feet, for safety’s sake. And where there are rock climbers, you’ll likely find slackliners.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/rNjRXKssXvGDna.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WMAerial_EN-US3723194276_200x200.jpg" alt="Aerial view of the Washington Monument in Washington"></div><div class="explore-label">Aerial view of the Washington Monument in Washington</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GzbcHlrcRKtwGP.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwiftFox_EN-US3962578167_200x200.jpg" alt="Swift fox pups in Grasslands National Park near Val Marie in Saskatchewan"></div><div class="explore-label">Swift fox pups in Grasslands National Park near Val Marie in Saskatchewan</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XOMHgTYGmAKtyA.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldRushYukon_EN-US6083758123_200x200.jpg" alt="Yukon River viewed from the Midnight Dome"></div><div class="explore-label">Yukon River viewed from the Midnight Dome</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YgzUlqLaWdxtmm.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReplicaFlyer_EN-US6328727049_200x200.jpg" alt="Replica of the Wright Flyer undergoing aerodynamic tests at NASA's Langley Research Center"></div><div class="explore-label">Replica of the Wright Flyer undergoing aerodynamic tests at NASA's Langley Research Center</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ragltpLEuyhTgQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlackRockCity_EN-US6804847775_200x200.jpg" alt="Satellite image of the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City"></div><div class="explore-label">Satellite image of the Burning Man festival in Black Rock City</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
