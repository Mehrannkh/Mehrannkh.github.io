Is that whistling you hear coming from a chamois, that great-antlered species of goat-antelope? Could it be the howls of an endangered wolf echoing off the mountainside? Or the bellowing of the Marsican brown bear, one of only 50 or so left on Earth? Most likely it's just the cold November wind blowing through this, the oldest beech tree forest in all of Europe. Hard to believe that this vast stand of primeval forest is just a two-hour drive east from Rome's busiest airport.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/oDlUXKdXEAuAPn.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountTaranaki_EN-US8879642420_800x600.jpg" alt="Mount Taranaki"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Mount Taranaki</h2><p class="date">November 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">According to the legends of New Zealand's Indigenous Māori people, the lonely Mount Taranaki wasn't always lonely. Taranaki, the story goes, once lived among other mountains in the North Island's center. But Taranaki feuded with the powerful volcano Tongariro over the love of the pretty peak Pīhanga. In their epic battle, the now flat-topped Tongariro lost his head but emerged victorious. The vanquished Taranaki wandered west, cutting trenches as he trudged to the shore and filling them with lovesick tears to create the region's rivers.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EqYuMrUVWwCUfR.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EDCScotland_EN-US8946271864_800x600.jpg" alt="Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland</h2><p class="date">November 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Located on a small island where three sea lochs meet in northwestern Scotland, the current Eilean Donan Castle is just the latest incarnation of several monastic cells and Scottish clan strongholds that have occupied the tidal islet since the 7th century. The first fortified castle was built in the 13th century to defend against invading Vikings who occupied much of Scotland at the time. An iconic symbol of Scotland, from the 14th to 18th centuries the castle was mostly held by the Mackenzies and defended by the MacRaes, both storied clans of the Scottish Highlands. The castle was destroyed in 1719 by the invading British Royal Navy during the Jacobite Uprising, but was rebuilt along its earlier design in the early 20th century by Lt. Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/nzsyUqsklzKEIF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Dromling_EN-US8056662773_200x200.jpg" alt="Common cranes in the Drömling wetland"></div><div class="explore-label">Common cranes in the Drömling wetland</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/CATTHdXYoRwjiE.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AsilomarSB_EN-US8366690151_200x200.jpg" alt="Huge waves crashing on rocks along Asilomar State Beach"></div><div class="explore-label">Huge waves crashing on rocks along Asilomar State Beach</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HwAXvtZucROFUJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KobukRiver_EN-US1344443933_200x200.jpg" alt="Caribou swimming across Alaska's Kobuk River during fall migration"></div><div class="explore-label">Caribou swimming across Alaska's Kobuk River during fall migration</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GbPqJvtSJtlUwe.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TwoWest_EN-US4160752221_200x200.jpg" alt="West Indian manatees in Three Sisters Springs"></div><div class="explore-label">West Indian manatees in Three Sisters Springs</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cqsZmBMDWqlMXw.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ValCervara_EN-US8802099255_200x200.jpg" alt="Partly snow-covered slope in Val Cervara"></div><div class="explore-label">Partly snow-covered slope in Val Cervara</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
