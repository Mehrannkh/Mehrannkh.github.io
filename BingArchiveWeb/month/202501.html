Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favor throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne, and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods, and giving gifts.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QXQwkFKZmHOgch.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArdezSwitzerland_EN-US8405268165_800x600.jpg" alt="Star trails over Ardez"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Star trails over Ardez</h2><p class="date">January 2, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Perched on a terrace above the Inn Valley at 4,790 feet, Ardez is a hidden gem in eastern Switzerland renowned for its deep cultural roots and stunning preservation of history.
