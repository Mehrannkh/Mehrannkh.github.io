Completed in 1895, this towering Flemish Renaissance Revival masterpiece doesn't just dominate the skyline; it defines it. For nearly eight decades, it stood as the city's tallest building, a title it proudly held until 1973. Designed by architect Henry C. Koch, this hall blends German-inspired architecture with Milwaukee's own historic influences. That connection isn't accidental—its design pays tribute to the city's strong German heritage, which shaped much of the surrounding neighborhood as well.<br><br>One of the building's most fascinating features lies beneath your feet: its foundation rests on more than 2,500 white pine piles driven deep into the marshy banks of the Milwaukee River. Inside, visitors are greeted by a soaring eight-story atrium crowned with a glass skylight, seen in today's image.<br><br>Recognized for its significance, Milwaukee City Hall earned a spot on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was named a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Today, it's still the beating heart of Milwaukee's civic life and a must-see for anyone curious about the city's story.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202601.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./ULZckUgyppPQZV.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./ThwpLzdcrSLFvw.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
