The redwoods in the monument are 600-800 years old, on average, with the oldest being at least 1,200. The tallest tree is about 258 feet, though redwoods grow as high as 379 feet farther north. Redwoods are an important part of the forest ecosystem.

This wasn't exactly the first light bulb, but it was the first practical and inexpensive one, a key technological innovation that introduced a new era. To mark the day, we're looking at the bright lights of New York City and its surrounding area, as seen from the International Space Station.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GBzxHQTeQjaYAp.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapeDisappointment_EN-US8548904341_800x600.jpg" alt="Cape Disappointment Lighthouse in Ilwaco"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Cape Disappointment Lighthouse in Ilwaco</h2><p class="date">January 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In recognition of the modern US Coast Guard, formed on this day in 1915, we're featuring the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse, one of many lighthouses managed by the USCG. How did Cape Disappointment get its name? A British fur trader in 1788 mistook the mouth of the Columbia River for a bay and was disappointed because his ship couldn't pass due to the river's shallow bar. Many ships would eventually sink in these dangerous waters, but this lighthouse has warned off countless others since it was lit in 1856, making it the first lighthouse in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the lighthouses in the US have been built and maintained by the US Coast Guard and its predecessors.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jgRypOoHzDObkc.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SemucChampey_EN-US8613323076_800x600.jpg" alt="Semuc Champey"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Semuc Champey</h2><p class="date">January 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">While it's snowy and cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere this time of year, December and January are popular months to visit Guatemala, where the skies are clear, but everything is still green and lush from autumn rains.

The species has a reputation for bold, energetic feeding behavior that can resemble a frenetic dance. As it stalks its prey in shallow water, the reddish egret is prone to prance, stagger, and leap, while strategically positioning its wings to block the glare of the sun and boldly stab at fish. It's one of many species that make Florida a year-round delight for birdwatchers.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/wmhBuFzFYMOQQM.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Rakan_EN-US8096736799_200x200.jpg" alt="Rakan statues at Daisho-in Temple"></div><div class="explore-label">Rakan statues at Daisho-in Temple</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YQwRrWUaWWJHhY.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SouthernGate_EN-US8348473546_200x200.jpg" alt="The Chinese New Year celebration in Xi'an"></div><div class="explore-label">The Chinese New Year celebration in Xi'an</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cLnbalKywluEBW.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SafariSavannah_EN-US8123928986_200x200.jpg" alt="Zebras and wildebeests in the Serengeti National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Zebras and wildebeests in the Serengeti National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lWowctXhzPyodU.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeagueNations_EN-US9107893638_200x200.jpg" alt="Flags outside the UN's Palace of Nations in Geneva"></div><div class="explore-label">Flags outside the UN's Palace of Nations in Geneva</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/drbQanEdJcuzuv.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarchWA1963_EN-US7913146423_200x200.jpg" alt="The front line of demonstrators during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28"></div><div class="explore-label">The front line of demonstrators during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
