Because cheetahs have uniquely flexible spines, they're able to make sharp, sudden turns, even during a high-speed chase. Individual cheetahs tend to avoid one another, but a cub like this one will stay with its mother for about 18 months, and a female cub may stick with mom into adulthood.

Despite its name, the hooved wild mountain goat is not a true goat—in fact, it's the only genus and species of its kind in the world. Found only in northwestern North America, its closest relatives aren't domestic goats, but the chamois of Europe and the goral and serow of Asia.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dIUCUufPOnmUbi.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WesterheverLight_EN-US2289133174_800x600.jpg" alt="Westerheversand Lighthouse in Westerhever"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Westerheversand Lighthouse in Westerhever</h2><p class="date">December 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Even in the places most altered by humans, nature seems to slip through, like the Milky Way shown here peeking between light beams from Germany's Westerheversand Lighthouse.
