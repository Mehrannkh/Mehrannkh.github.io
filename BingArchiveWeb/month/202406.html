Taking place in the first full week of June, this event was created by the National Garden Clubs, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the joys of horticulture. First celebrated in 1987 this week is all about getting more people involved in gardening and spreading awareness of how important gardens are. Being home to a wide range of trees, flowers, shrubs, and grasses, gardens can help the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide, filtering water, and encouraging insect life. Gardening clubs across the country celebrate this week by organizing workshops, visiting public gardens, or placing plants at public facilities. They're also great for people; tending to a garden is good exercise, and being outside in the sunshine is a great way to get more vitamin D. Gardening can even boost your mood, helping you to feel more relaxed and peaceful.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qSGCjXbcQXpCWl.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CopenhagenBicycles_EN-US6431027482_800x600.jpg" alt="Bicycles in Copenhagen"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Bicycles in Copenhagen</h2><p class="date">June 3, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Bicycles are the best!

The village's name derives from the word 'ubad,' meaning medicine. Nestled within the verdant landscape, the village is rich in Hindu temples and local mythology. The mythical character seen in today’s image is Barong, a panther-like creature, the king of spirits, and a symbol of good fortune and prosperity. The Barong dance, performed in a decorated animal mask, is native to Bali.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/fspGfXABoofNmI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MadagascarRiver_EN-US6642458773_200x200.jpg" alt="Masoala National Park in Madagascar"></div><div class="explore-label">Masoala National Park in Madagascar</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tizTekGQnPkbGE.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BardenasBiosphere_EN-US6936891495_200x200.jpg" alt="Bardenas Reales Biosphere Reserve and Natural Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Bardenas Reales Biosphere Reserve and Natural Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ONyfDkiMFRuuUl.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TourCorsica_EN-US3437831281_200x200.jpg" alt="Cyclists in the 2013 Tour de France"></div><div class="explore-label">Cyclists in the 2013 Tour de France</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hsKPnSFArMcWYO.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrideMonthSF_EN-US6251373281_200x200.jpg" alt="San Francisco City Hall lit up in rainbow lights for Pride"></div><div class="explore-label">San Francisco City Hall lit up in rainbow lights for Pride</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cihCOYCptAFPcY.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedFoxDad_EN-US9773161483_200x200.jpg" alt="Red fox father and kit"></div><div class="explore-label">Red fox father and kit</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
