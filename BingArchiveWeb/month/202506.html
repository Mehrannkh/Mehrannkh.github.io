Nearly everyone lives within 15 minutes of essentials—and over 90% of residents can reach key places in just 10 minutes. This wasn't always the case. It was only in the 1970s, sparked by an oil crisis, rising car-related issues, and strong social movements, that the Netherlands started prioritizing bikes over cars. Since then, cities have embraced bike-friendly streets, dedicated lanes, and traffic lights for cyclists.

This frog lives high in the canopies of Central and South America, especially in Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Ecuador and Colombia. It spends its days snoozing on leaves and its nights foraging for insects. With vertical pupils and a golden glow, oversized eyes help this frog spot prey in the dark. Thanks to sticky toe pads and strong limbs, it can cling to branches and leaves like a pro, even in the canopy's slippery heights.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/SLKEsfqwWEYdVk.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrideParade_EN-US9405333794_800x600.jpg" alt="Rainbow flags at New York Pride"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Rainbow flags at New York Pride</h2><p class="date">June 28, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York's Greenwich Village met unexpected resistance. Fed up with years of harassment, LGBTQIA+ patrons fought back. What followed was six days of unrest—and the start of a movement. Led in part by trans activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, the uprising challenged not only police brutality but society's silence. Stonewall wasn't the beginning of queer existence, but it was the moment people said 'no more' loud enough to be heard worldwide. The first Pride marches came the next year, not as parties, but as protests. Thousands marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago to mark the anniversary of Stonewall. Holding signs and chanting for liberation, they demanded visibility, rights, and justice.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ROUsKujvYvmOVC.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BandaIsland_EN-US9494080788_800x600.jpg" alt="Blue lagoon at Pulau Ay"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Blue lagoon at Pulau Ay</h2><p class="date">June 29, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Every June 29, the International Day of the Tropics shines a light on the equator-hugging zone where the sun sticks around, and climate conversations get real. The tropics span a broad region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, including parts of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Central America, and South America. Nearly 40% of the global population lives in this band, which also hosts 80% of the world's biodiversity. It's rich in culture, nature, and history—but also under pressure from rising temperatures, deforestation, and fast-paced urban growth.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FXutJePmGenjzI.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WolfeCrater_EN-US2390330059_800x600.jpg" alt="Wolfe Creek Crater"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Wolfe Creek Crater</h2><p class="date">June 30, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Each scar on Earth from a meteorite impact tells a story—from the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs to the lesser-known craters that dot the planet. Asteroid Day highlights ongoing research into asteroids and the potential threats they pose. Started in 2015 and backed by the United Nations, this day marks the anniversary of the Tunguska event—a massive explosion that occurred in Siberia on June 30, 1908. This explosion flattened over 800 square miles of Siberian forest near the Tunguska River. The blast released energy equal to 10–15 megatons of TNT, a standard measure of explosive force. Since then, craters like Arizona's Barringer, Quebec's Manicouagan, and others have helped scientists study what happens when space rocks hit Earth.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/KxGeEnDUtTQsFx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlagCapitolDC_EN-US1553861171_200x200.jpg" alt="Flag display at the US Capitol"></div><div class="explore-label">Flag display at the US Capitol</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FicyCBXdnQJOFf.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DubrovnikTwilight_EN-US9005720216_200x200.jpg" alt="Old City of Dubrovnik in Dalmatia"></div><div class="explore-label">Old City of Dubrovnik in Dalmatia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/bQKtHJBsUbFnRq.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SplendidFrog_EN-US9346105347_200x200.jpg" alt="Splendid leaf frog"></div><div class="explore-label">Splendid leaf frog</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/AziFFapjGVcgmw.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SanMiguelAzores_EN-US2785372768_200x200.jpg" alt="Vila Franca Islet"></div><div class="explore-label">Vila Franca Islet</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/UcLMBwuXblDiSQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SerengetiGiraffe_EN-US2127484447_200x200.jpg" alt="Masai giraffe mother grooming her calf in the Serengeti"></div><div class="explore-label">Masai giraffe mother grooming her calf in the Serengeti</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
