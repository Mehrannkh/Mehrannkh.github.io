Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.<br><br>On this day, it is hard to miss how the red and white houses in Tilting mirror the colors of the Canadian flag. Tilting, a village on Fogo Island in Newfoundland and Labrador, was settled by Irish immigrants in the 18th century. It remains a unique example of an Irish outport community that has preserved its cultural identity. The bright fishing sheds and homes weren't painted just for aesthetics; the hues make buildings easier to spot during heavy fog or snowfall. These vivid colors also reflect the practical, resourceful life of the people who settled here.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202507.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./FXutJePmGenjzI.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./HYANaRSoHwcNnC.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
