Mother's Day is a time to honor the women who shape our lives, celebrating motherhood, unbreakable bonds, and their lasting impact on society. While the modern American version of this holiday began in the early 20th century, the celebration of motherhood has existed for centuries across cultures. Social activist Anna Jarvis led the inaugural Mother's Day worship service in 1908 at Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church in Grafton, West Virginia, now home to the International Mother's Day Shrine.<br><br>Perfectly capturing a touching moment of motherhood in the wild, today's image features a leopard mother and her cub. This bond extends beyond infancy, as mothers continue to nurture and support their young even after weaning. Leopard mothers share territory with their cubs, providing protection and guidance as they grow. At around nine weeks, cubs begin eating meat, and by three months, they start joining hunts, learning essential survival skills. By their first year, they can fend for themselves, but they typically stay with their mother for up to two years before venturing out on their own. In times of scarcity, mothers have been known to share their kills, ensuring their cubs remain nourished and strong. Their relationship embodies the essence of motherhood—teaching, protecting, and preparing the next generation for life ahead.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202505.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./wmQpiGmJdemnMJ.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./HQhRtUkAHYcMmH.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
