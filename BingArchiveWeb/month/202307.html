The grueling event, first held in 1903, sees teams race more than 2,100 miles through the Pyrenees and the Alps to finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The competition is divided into 21 day-long stages and while some parts stay the same, others vary from year to year. For example, our image features the Pont du Gard—an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that was built during the first century AD—which only appeared in the 2019 race. The entire event takes place over a 23-day period, including rest days, as teams of eight cyclists compete for a cash prize and the coveted yellow jersey. For these riders, this competition is the apex of years of training and dedication.

Mangrove coverage is thought to have halved over the past 40 years, and they are dwindling much faster than forests overall. The UN has established the International Day of Mangrove Conservation, scientific funding, Global Geoparks, and World Heritage sites to try to reverse these trends. These efforts are vital; mangroves help prevent erosion and protect against storm surges, as well as providing a home for fish, crustaceans, and other wildlife.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YgzFIBTuffrEhI.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ParisLouvre_EN-US2282259448_800x600.jpg" alt="Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and Louvre Pyramid"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel and Louvre Pyramid</h2><p class="date">July 27, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Paris features an impressive stretch of parks, gardens, and monuments called the Axe historique, or historical axis, that starts at the Louvre Museum, in the city center, and extends west, ending at La Grande Arche. Today's image shows the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel at the eastern end of the route, with the embodiment of Peace riding a chariot atop it. It shouldn't be confused with the better-known and much larger Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, which stands 2 miles away, halfway along the Axe historique. It's a lovely walk from one to the other, through the Jardin Des Tuileries and along the famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées. If the statue on the left side of the photo caught your eye, wave hello to King Louis XIV on horseback.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/kExsVodCgKSMeP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SanBlasIslands_EN-US1442226155_800x600.jpg" alt="San Blas Islands"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">San Blas Islands</h2><p class="date">July 28, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Nestled off the northern coast of Panama, the San Blas Islands are an archipelago of more than 360 islands in the Caribbean Sea. Known for their clean, calm waters, they are the perfect place for adventure sports such as snorkeling, surfing, and diving. Staghorn and pillar coral are among the species found in coral reefs surrounding the islands, which teem with marine life. The islands are inhabited primarily by Gunas—people indigenous to Guna Yala—who preserve their way of living with vibrant, traditional clothing, thatched-roof huts known as 'bohíos,' and intricate, handcrafted mola textiles.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xdjlUqXxswLppY.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TigerIndia_EN-US1594590553_800x600.jpg" alt="Bengal tiger"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Bengal tiger</h2><p class="date">July 29, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's International Tiger Day! A day to celebrate these magnificent animals and consider how best they can be protected. The largest wild cats in the world, all tiger species are endangered, facing challenges including habitat loss, the illegal wildlife trade, and poaching. The Bengal tiger, an iconic subspecies primarily found in India, is the star of today's image. As apex predators, Bengal tigers play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by controlling populations of deer, wild boar, and bison. With an estimated population in the wild of between 2,500 and 3,000, tiger conservation is crucial to secure the future of this majestic species.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lEWlOZPayAGDVU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PalouseHills_EN-US1737990003_800x600.jpg" alt="Farmland in the Palouse"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Farmland in the Palouse</h2><p class="date">July 30, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Palouse region in the Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque landscapes, agricultural heritage, and unique geological features.

This corridor, halfway up a 150-foot cliff, was carved by erosion and has offered shelter to various dwellers over different periods. Long before European settlers arrived, the area's Native American people are believed to have used Rock House as a refuge. Small recesses in the rock walls are thought to have been used as baking ovens, while troughs gouged in the cave's floor helped them to collect water. The walls of Rock House have seven window-like openings, allowing sunlight to filter through, casting beautiful patterns inside the cave and offering cliffside views over the trees for generations of Rock House dwellers.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/ZCMynlUCBZDKNP.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WorldPopDay_EN-US3018429136_200x200.jpg" alt="Hong Kong SAR"></div><div class="explore-label">Hong Kong SAR</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dpSFgTKLMkbQBc.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MoselleRiver_EN-US2499319157_200x200.jpg" alt="Moselle River loop"></div><div class="explore-label">Moselle River loop</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IuhsJhuLQlNMsO.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CooperChapel_EN-US2412561000_200x200.jpg" alt="Mildred B.
