Once known as the independent Republic of Ragusa, this city was a major maritime power and trading hub from the 14th to the 19th century. Situated in southern Dalmatia along the Adriatic Sea, its success was built on diplomacy and seafaring. The Walls of Dubrovnik, built between the 13th and 17th centuries, stretch for over 1.2 miles, with towers, forts, and bastions still standing strong. The current layout of the walls follows a city plan from 1292, when Dubrovnik was rebuilt after a fire under Venetian rule.<br><br>Inside these walls is the Old City—a compact grid of polished limestone streets, baroque churches, and centuries-old residences. Everything here, including the 15th-century Rector's Palace, Sponza Palace, and the Church of St. Blaise, reflects the city's independent past. The Franciscan Monastery, Europe's oldest still operating pharmacy, adds another layer of charm to this vintage place. Dubrovnik might seem familiar. That's because it has represented the cities of King's Landing and Qarth in 'Game of Thrones,' putting it on the pop culture map. It's not just a touristy location—it's a city that has been writing its own script for over a thousand years.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202506.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./nSGkVVZKNBjzce.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./PuYPCdpBDelZrY.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
