It's one of 27 frescoes that make up this collection of wall-sized paintings.Rivera spent three months studying at the Ford Motor Company’s River Rouge complex in preparation for this project, making hundreds of sketches before painting a single stroke. The work was started during the Great Depression in 1932, making the perspective all the more meaningful. When it was finished eight months later, the US economy was moving toward recovery. Rivera’s murals remain on display at the Detroit Institute of Arts. Rivera believed the work was his most successful piece and Edsel Ford, who helped commission the paintings, liked it too, saying, ‘I admire Rivera's spirit.

The island of Bali has a rich tradition of agriculture, with an especially unique method of water management for rice farming. The irrigation system here, known as Subak, is recognized by UNESCO for its cultural significance. Water flows through temples and into the rice paddies, carved into the hillsides like steps.

Many of the stars (and planets) sparkle in the Milky Way, our galactic home in the universe. It’s a big reason why astrotourists and photographers visit at night, to see the light show above. But for those who follow the sun, daytime is perfect for hiking and camping, wildlife viewing, and discovering rock art left behind by prehistoric peoples.Today we’re celebrating 55 years since President Lyndon B.

Walruses launch from the ice to eat, making the floating blocks an important part of their survival. With the effects of climate change increasing, Arctic ice is melting, posing an existential threat to the ancient pinnipeds.Although walruses are agile swimmers, they move slowly on land, lumbering about on their flippers. The animals are big, growing up to 12 feet, with tusks that can be as long as 3 feet. Walruses use their tusks to fight and to poke up through the ice.

Why does National Hispanic Heritage Month begin on September 15 and not at the start of the month? The date was chosen because September 15 marks the anniversary of independence for five Latin American countries—Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras—places from which many Latin Americans in the US and their ancestors have immigrated. The monthlong celebration is marked with events throughout the country, from an annual festival in Fayetteville, Arkansas, to ceremonies within all branches of the US military.The Smithsonian Institution also holds special events during Hispanic Heritage Month—in 2012, the Smithsonian featured an exhibit of this colorful VW Beetle, called the Vochol, at the National Museum of the American Indian in honor of the holiday. The word ‘Vochol’ combines the popular term in Mexico for the Beetle (Vocho), and Huichol, the name of an indigenous people of western Mexico, members of which turned this car into a modern take on their traditional artwork. Beadwork like this reflects Huichol culture and has long been considered an expression of Huichol spiritual faith. The patterns are created with colored beads, traditionally made from bone, clay, stone, coral, turquoise, pyrite, jade, and seeds.The Vochol is covered by more than 2 million ceramic and glass beads affixed with pounds of resin and arranged in geometric patterns, with references to deer and other revered animals. Two Huichol families worked together for more than 9,000 hours to create it. Since it was unveiled in December 2010, the car has become something of a celebrity. It has its own website and went on tour throughout Mexico, the US, Europe, and Canada, and has been displayed in several museums alongside other important works of art.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cvxnRGGSraMLjB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MushroomMonth_EN-US8427258585_800x600.jpg" alt="Detail of a portobello mushroom"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Detail of a portobello mushroom</h2><p class="date">September 16, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">By featuring the gills of this portobello mushroom on Bing's homepage, we're tipping our hat to National Mushroom Month, an event showcasing the one type of fungus that's become a staple on restaurant menus and dinner plates—the marvelous mushroom.

It's a day to learn about these subjects, as well as a day many people become naturalized citizens in group ceremonies. (On average, about 700,000 people become US citizens every year.) To celebrate, we're looking at an unusual close-up of the Statue of Liberty, a welcoming sight to immigrants and a symbol of freedom since 1886. The statue's tablet has the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) inscribed in Roman numerals: JULY IV MDCCLXXVI.So why is today both Constitution Day and Citizenship Day? The reason is rooted in the World War II era. In 1940, Congress created I Am an American Day, a demonstration of US patriotism. Twelve years later, President Harry Truman signed into law Citizenship Day, which replaced I Am an American Day and moved the observance to September 17, the day the Constitution was signed in 1787.

At the end of the festival, attendees come out in droves for the pièce de résistance—a musical fireworks display known as the ‘piromusical.’</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EpzCGsbGsklLMS.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FeatherSerpent_EN-US2734435636_800x600.jpg" alt="Equinox at the Temple of Kukulcan in Chichen Itza"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Equinox at the Temple of Kukulcan in Chichen Itza</h2><p class="date">September 23, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Look closely and you'll see a snake slithering down the steps of the Temple of Kukulcan (aka El Castillo or The Castle), in Chichen Itza, Mexico. Not a real snake, it's an image created by natural light and shadows only during the spring and fall equinoxes. The equinox (which means equal night in Latin) is either of the two times each year—like today, the first day of fall—when the Earth's orbit and position cause the sun to pass directly over the equator, creating equal amounts of daylight and darkness. According to Mayan legend, on both equinoxes this pyramid is visited by Kukulcan, the feathered serpent god. Thousands of spectators gather to watch and celebrate as seven triangles of light slide down the pyramid, illustrating Kukulcan's descent.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MNhUZTkuDJfNCx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UgandaGorilla_EN-US2620785147_800x600.jpg" alt="A mountain gorilla eating in a tree in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">A mountain gorilla eating in a tree in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park</h2><p class="date">September 24, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In the canopy of Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a mountain gorilla leans into a meal of succulent green leaves. By day's end, she'll likely eat close to 40 pounds of foliage. Locals call this forest Bwindi, which means 'impenetrable,' but to this mountain gorilla, it's simply home. Like us (and most primates), these gentle giants have opposable thumbs, which makes picking and eating an easy task. Also like us, mountain gorillas prefer hanging out on the ground. In fact, they're known to stand upright and walk short distances with a remarkably human-like gait. We humans share 98 percent of our DNA with gorillas (both the eastern and western species), nearly as much as we share with chimps and bonobos. So yes, even though they have more body hair, we're all hominids.On World Gorilla Day, observed September 24, we celebrate these great apes and support the ongoing work to protect them. While all gorilla species are endangered, only about 1,000 mountain gorillas are still living in the wild, making them critically endangered. It's largely thanks to the pioneering work and selfless dedication of primatologist Dian Fossey that many of us are aware of their plight. Today, gorillas remain plagued by the same threats Fossey witnessed more than four decades ago:  poaching, disease, destruction of habitat, and human conflict. But census reports are reassuring; there are signs that the mountain gorilla population is increasing, but conservation efforts are critical to the species' survival.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wWgsWGHiAvmOHj.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LofotenSurfing_EN-US2786067859_800x600.jpg" alt="Arctic surfing in the Lofoten Islands"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Arctic surfing in the Lofoten Islands</h2><p class="date">September 25, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Surfers from Norway and around the world gather each September in Unstad, a tiny village in Norway's Lofoten Islands, to compete in the Lofoten Masters, which bills itself as the world's northernmost surfing competition.

Sea otters live mostly in the water and use the thick blades of kelp to anchor themselves as they sleep and to keep their buoyant pups from floating away. Just as the kelp helps otters, sea otters help the kelp, too. They ensure the kelp's survival by eating sea urchins. If sea urchin populations are left unchecked, these spiny vacuum cleaners of the sea destroy kelp forests by munching on holdfasts that tether kelp to the ocean floor. The resulting clear-cut areas, called urchin barrens, are devastating to the overall ecosystem. Kelp forests provide food and safe harbor for hundreds of fish species and other sea creatures. They also remove carbon dioxide from the air, a benefit to us all.This week is Sea Otter Awareness Week, so let's thank these 'Keepers of the Kelp' for gobbling up those sea urchins.

And soon the 600 wineries in this smallest Spanish province will begin the lengthy process to turn this year's grape harvest into its world-famous Rioja wines. (To get an idea of how tiny La Rioja province is, it makes up just 1 percent of Spain's land area and only about 0.67 percent of Spain's population lives here.) While winemaking techniques have evolved and improved over the thousands of years that wine has been made here, each year around this time locals and visitors gather in the region's capital of Logroño to celebrate the wine harvest and see a traditional example of the first, uh, step of this process—crushing newly harvested grapes by stomping them with bare feet.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gOxyjdKiRINgCj.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DaxingPKX_EN-US3995932442_800x600.jpg" alt="An aerial view of Beijing Daxing International Airport"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">An aerial view of Beijing Daxing International Airport</h2><p class="date">September 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Last Wednesday, September 25, China officially opened the world’s largest airplane terminal, Beijing Daxing International Airport.
