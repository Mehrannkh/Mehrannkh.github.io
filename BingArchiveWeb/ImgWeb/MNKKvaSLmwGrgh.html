Positioned high on an extinct volcano, the castle's royal connections go back nearly 1,000 years, and its walls have witnessed wars, royal births, executions, and other dramas. But what really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots.<br><br>Legend has it that the Grey Lady, Janet Douglas, roams the castle's corridors. Also known as Lady Glamis, a noblewoman accused of witchcraft by King James V, she is believed to still lament her fiery execution in 1537. Others say the Grey Lady might be the ghost of Marie de Guise—mother of Mary, Queen of Scots—mourning her lost power amid the turmoil of religious reform. Then there's the Dung Man, a prisoner who attempted to escape in a wheelbarrow full of excrement. He died from the fall when the cart was emptied from the castle wall. The lost piper, who vanished into underground tunnels, continues to play a haunting melody beneath the city. And in 2001, the shadowy figure of a man in a leather apron emerged during a paranormal research project, leaving volunteers with a chilling memory.
