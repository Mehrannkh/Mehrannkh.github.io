And right now, reefs aren't doing too well. What can we do?

Since the Middle Ages, this spot has been a destination for religious pilgrimages. The faithful are drawn no doubt by the views and, perhaps, the dangerous path to get there—enlightenment shouldn't come easy.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/rFrGrchlEZRPov.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrideEmpire_EN-US6567530966_800x600.jpg" alt="The Empire State Building lit up in honor of Pride Week in 2014"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Empire State Building lit up in honor of Pride Week in 2014</h2><p class="date">June 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Since 1970, New York City has celebrated LGBTQIA+ pride with a parade, public speeches and rallies, and record-setting crowds—officials estimate the 2019 NYC Pride March drew in 5 million people.

And it's not a one-time event. The goats enjoy the small yellow fruit these trees produce, and when the low-hanging fruit is gone they're willing and able to make the climb. Goats aren't the only ones benefitting from these trees. The nuts from argan trees are used to produce argan oil, which is edible and also used for some rather pricey cosmetics, making it a valuable export.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DdDETUZqtdPiJd.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JabiruStork_EN-US3292555889_800x600.jpg" alt="Jabiru storks in the Pantanal of Brazil"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Jabiru storks in the Pantanal of Brazil</h2><p class="date">June 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">You're more likely to see jabiru storks down on the shores of ponds or on riverbanks, where they hunt for small fish, amphibians, and lizards. They're the tallest flying bird in South and Central America, with the largest males standing 5 feet. Despite their size, jabiru storks are graceful fliers. Here in the Pantanal, a sprawling tropical wetland in western Brazil, jabiru storks will build a massive nest in late August or September—just as spring is beginning in the Southern Hemisphere. The stork mates in this image may be scouting out a good place for their nest. And once it's built, the pair will raise anywhere from two to five jabiru stork chicks.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/PHLIsLpQCDkbvB.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SurfSeason_EN-US9920705587_200x200.jpg" alt="Surfer on the beach in Medewi"></div><div class="explore-label">Surfer on the beach in Medewi</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BtEfHXsUXgtYOf.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.StStephens_EN-US3615346032_200x200.jpg" alt="St. Stephen's Green in Dublin"></div><div class="explore-label">St. Stephen's Green in Dublin</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IJqVuffyefKCkO.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaElena_EN-US1850505356_200x200.jpg" alt="Santa Elena Canyon under the Milky Way in Big Bend National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Santa Elena Canyon under the Milky Way in Big Bend National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DdDETUZqtdPiJd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.JabiruStork_EN-US3292555889_200x200.jpg" alt="Jabiru storks in the Pantanal of Brazil"></div><div class="explore-label">Jabiru storks in the Pantanal of Brazil</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nnUdHpuuuRAvlD.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LionSurfing_EN-US1478093197_200x200.jpg" alt="Galápagos sea lion off the shore of Fernandina Island"></div><div class="explore-label">Galápagos sea lion off the shore of Fernandina Island</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
