It was part of the 2016 edition of Passages Insolites (Unusual Passages), an annual public art exhibition in the historic Petit-Champlain and Saint-Roch districts of the city. The canoe has long been associated with Canada's national history, linked with early explorers, fur traders, Indigenous peoples, and colonists who ventured out into the wilderness of the great north. The artist behind this installation, Giorgia Volpe, was inspired by 'the idea of migration and its influence on the formation of our society and our territory.'

Mangroves thrive here at the boundary between land and sea, growing in coastal salt water and low-oxygen conditions where other trees would quickly die. Their complex root systems filter out the salt and form a strong natural defense against storm surges, rising sea levels, and coastal erosion. Mangroves also create aquatic nursery habitats that support a highly diverse range of juvenile fish and crustaceans.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RjUpLXDvdurEPV.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AdlerPlanetarium_EN-US9558785232_800x600.jpg" alt="Adler Planetarium near Lake Michigan"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Adler Planetarium near Lake Michigan</h2><p class="date">July 27, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">When it first flicked on the projector lights in 1930, the Adler Planetarium in Chicago was the only one in the Western Hemisphere, and it featured an innovative new lens imported from Germany.

But that could change quickly: Sea goldies are protogynous hermaphrodites, meaning that when there aren't enough fellas around, the largest females change sex to become male, turning purplish and growing even larger. All goldies are born female, but those that switch to male enjoy instantly better odds at mating time: For every male goldie there are up to 10 females.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dRiYcvVgIIuZOv.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PantheraTigris_EN-US9729163497_800x600.jpg" alt="Tiger camouflaged in tall grass"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Tiger camouflaged in tall grass</h2><p class="date">July 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're in Assam, India, to celebrate International Tiger Day, the annual celebration of the magnificent striped cats that have captured our imagination through the ages.

They're medium-sized and both males and females sport similar jewel-toned plumage. This group perching in Mkomazi National Park in Tanzania is mostly made up of the northern carmine variety—with blue-green heads and mostly red bodies—plus a few European bee-eaters seemingly for accent color.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/rGezvKQiOPwpQu.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PrathameshJaju_EN-US8876008160_200x200.jpg" alt="Composite image of the moon"></div><div class="explore-label">Composite image of the moon</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nExmwXqgoekhWm.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NgoDong_EN-US7569222084_200x200.jpg" alt="Boats float by rice fields on the Ngo Dong River in Ninh Bình province"></div><div class="explore-label">Boats float by rice fields on the Ngo Dong River in Ninh Bình province</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/kZOYlPkJrDvkRC.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OtterCliff_EN-US6679872579_200x200.jpg" alt="Otter Cliffs"></div><div class="explore-label">Otter Cliffs</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/yXkapLoTpmpryf.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WakatobiNP_EN-US4475854788_200x200.jpg" alt="Wakatobi National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Wakatobi National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vIogXmZNDUWIfn.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TokyoMetropolis_EN-US9112375652_200x200.jpg" alt="Tokyo Tower in Minato City"></div><div class="explore-label">Tokyo Tower in Minato City</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
