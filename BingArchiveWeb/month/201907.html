The canoe has long been associated with Canada’s national history, linked with early explorers, fur traders, and colonists who ventured out into the wilderness of the great north. An image of a canoe even appeared on early versions of Canada’s silver dollar, a coin which was later replaced by the ‘loonie,’ so named for the depiction of a common loon on one side.Canada Day, celebrated on July 1, commemorates the date in 1867 when Canada was recognized as a self-governing country under the British Empire. It’s a national holiday for Canadians, which makes it a perfect day to take out the canoe.

They were taken during the Great American Eclipse of 2017.Just how does the moon perfectly blot out the sun? Through an amazing coincidence, the sun is both 400 times larger than the moon, and 400 times farther away from us here on Earth. Therefore, periodically, when the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned just right, the moon can perfectly obscure the sun as seen from the surface of Earth in a total eclipse. But, unlike the sun, the moon is not a smooth sphere; therefore, in the last few moments before the eclipse reaches totality, we see Baily's Beads. In 1836, English astronomer Francis Baily was the first to explain that the phenomenon is created by sunlight passing between the mountains and through the canyons of the moon. Some folks also refer to it as the diamond ring effect.

All across the United States on July 4, we come together as a nation to celebrate the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, one of the best break-up letters ever written.

Pictured on today’s homepage are the ruins of the cathedral on the grounds of Peel Castle, on St. Patrick’s Isle (which is connected by a causeway to the rest of the island). Vikings built the original wooden fortification during the 11th century on a location that had older Celtic monastic structures made of stone, which were incorporated into the castle. Over the next eight centuries, the various Norse, Scottish, and English rulers of the area added battlements, towers, and the cathedral to the grounds.After the Vikings incorporated the Isle of Man into their Kingdom of the Isles in the 9th century, they also brought their particular tradition of parliamentary government to the island. This tradition survives today as the Tynwald, the island’s tricameral parliament. Purportedly the oldest continuous parliament in the world, the Tynwald gathers outside on a special four-tiered hill every Tynwald Day—usually July 5—to promulgate the laws that have been passed in the last year.

The renovated path is far less dangerous than the original, which for many years had no guard rails. Made for workers back in 1905, the first walkway provided access between El Chorro and Gaitanejo hydroelectric power plants. After King Alfonso XIII visited in 1921, the walkway was given its nickname, El Caminito del Rey (The King’s Little Pathway). But after years of use and lack of upkeep, the nickname was updated to ‘The world’s most dangerous walkway.’By 2001, the trail was closed, riddled with holes, crumbling cement, and gaps where entire sections were missing. Luckily for thrill seekers, El Caminito del Rey is no longer off limits.

After mating at sea, these big mamas—leatherbacks are the largest of all turtles—haul themselves up onto beaches in the same region where they were born. The turtles dig out nests in the sand and lay a clutch of about 80 fertilized eggs the size of billiard balls. They'll repeat this ritual a few more times before returning to their migratory lives in the open ocean. About 65 days later, turtle hatchlings will start to poke up through the sand and make a dash toward the safety of the sea. But the odds are against them: Only 1 percent of the hatchlings will live to reach sexual maturity, at around 16 years old.The leatherbacks on our homepage today are in Trinidad and Tobago. The protected beaches of this island nation compose one of the most important nesting areas in the world for this endangered turtle. Scientists believe there are between 34,000 and 36,000 nesting females left worldwide, a big drop since 1980 when estimates put their population at about 115,000. (Male leatherbacks spend their entire lives at sea, so their numbers are harder to track.) Loss of habitat, fishing bycatch, and egg poaching are all blamed for the decline.

But we’d argue it’s their relatives, moths, that have the better story. With more than 160,000 species of moths around the world, moths outnumber butterfly species roughly 10 to 1. While most are nocturnal, the hummingbird hawk-moth on our homepage today breaks the mold. Found throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe, it’s shown here in the daylight of southern Sardinia, sipping nectar with its straw-like appendage known as a proboscis. Like a hummingbird, the moth makes a soft buzzing sound as it hovers over the flowers whose nectar it feeds on exclusively.During National Moth Week, held each year during the last week of July, ‘moth-ers’ all over are encouraged to be citizen scientists. You can participate by looking for moths in your own backyard (hint: leave a porch light on) and documenting your findings online. Happy ‘mothing’!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YZaYTdMHPaOdvN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Skywalk_EN-US4440241441_800x600.jpg" alt="The Skywalk on the Rock of Gibraltar"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Skywalk on the Rock of Gibraltar</h2><p class="date">July 23, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Make your way up the trails of this monolithic rock promontory to the Skywalk, an 8,000-square-foot glass platform that soars more than 1,100 feet above sea level. On a clear day, you can see three countries and two continents from here. These epic views draw tourists, as does the Rock’s legendary history. A British Overseas Territory since 1713, Gibraltar has long been a strategically important military outpost located near the southern tip of Europe on the Iberian Peninsula. Far below the Skywalk, visitors can take in military relics that date back to the first years of British rule here.Over time, the British Armed Forces built an extensive tunnel system through the limestone. The subterranean network was greatly expanded during World War II to accommodate 16,000 men and elaborate amenities, including a hospital, bakery, and water desalination plant. In November 1942, General Dwight D. Eisenhower operated a command center from the tunnels for Operation Torch—a mission that was a turning point in the war, marking the entry of US forces to fight alongside the British. The Skywalk is the newest attraction here, opening in March 2018 to great fanfare at a ceremony hosted by Mark Hamill, better known as Luke Skywalker.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jAtgyBxMMvZmCU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MeerkatMob_EN-US0017108852_800x600.jpg" alt="Meerkats in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Meerkats in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana</h2><p class="date">July 24, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Honestly, we're not sure who decided that July 24 was Cousins Day, but we're all for it—and these meerkats look like they are too. A clan (also called a mob, gang, or manor) usually contains about 20 or 30 meerkats, but some extended families have 50 or more. Females can detect the odor of their kin and use it to avoid inbreeding. They’re native to southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert in Botswana, which is where this clan was photographed.Cousins Day is about celebrating the family bonds between first cousins and even distant ones. You probably know that your first cousins are the children of your aunts and uncles, but what about their kids? They're not your second cousins—they're your first cousins once removed (one generation removed). Your children and the children of your first cousins are second cousins.

Its story starts in 1922, an era of speakeasies and flappers and a booming time in carousel history, when the rides were a symbol of a community’s prosperity. Jane’s Carousel was built in Idora Park in Youngstown, Ohio, a steel city.Like many carousels produced in that time, the ride eventually fell into disrepair. It was damaged in a fire and Idora Park closed to the public in 1984. That’s when New York couple Jane and David Walentas bought it for $385,000 at auction and shipped the carousel to Brooklyn for a waterfront restoration project. The carousel was painstakingly restored over a period of 27 years—a project overseen by Jane herself. It’s now housed in a glass ‘jewel box’ pavilion designed by Pritzker Prize-winner Jean Nouvel at Brooklyn Bridge Park. The cost of the entire project totaled $15 million—a testament to the love that Americans have for these nostalgic rides.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hWdLOAfJeUvSdM.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NendazAlpenhorn_EN-US3193438150_800x600.jpg" alt="Alphorn musicians perform during the International Alphorn Festival in Nendaz"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Alphorn musicians perform during the International Alphorn Festival in Nendaz</h2><p class="date">July 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">To usher in the summer music festival season, we take you to a pastoral hillside in the Swiss Alps for the International Alphorn Festival held each summer near the town of Nendaz. Musicians are gathering here this weekend to celebrate and blow these enormous traditional horns of the Alps. No one really knows the origin of the alphorn. We do know that for centuries, European mountain folks from the Alps and east to the Carpathian Mountains used this horn to signal to each other across great distances and to call in animal herds. Even though the horn has no valves or keyholes, it’s not easy to play and requires great lung power.Along with the Tibetan horn, the Australian didgeridoo, and South American erkencho, the alphorn shares the distinction of being one of the world’s original wooden wind instruments. Its design remains relatively unchanged over the past several centuries. Instrument makers once selected pine trees with crooked trunks that allowed them to craft the alphorn's curved sound cup from a single piece of wood. Nowadays, alphorns might be made of carefully joined pieces of a variety of woods, but it’s a serious infraction to compete with one not made entirely of wood. Best of luck to those competing for prizes at this year’s Alphorn Festival—may you blow your horns loud enough for us to enjoy here in North America.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IZfaNZDupfQJvL.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CahuitaNP_EN-US3238396594_800x600.jpg" alt="The shoreline of Cahuita National Park in Costa Rica"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The shoreline of Cahuita National Park in Costa Rica</h2><p class="date">July 27, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we’re hitting the beach in Costa Rica’s Cahuita National Park because, well, just take a look at this place.

After that, we’ll take a dip in the Caribbean waters offshore to marvel at coral reefs, sea turtles, and hundreds of species of fish.But of course, it is still summer here in North America, and we have plenty of local options for a day at the beach. Thousands of miles of ocean and lake shoreline are waiting to be explored, including coastlines in 85 US national parks (the National Park Service started protecting our seashores and lakeshores in 1930). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the US shoreline at 95,471 miles, with the Great Lakes delivering the most contiguous shores at 4,530 miles (more than the West or East Coasts).

Carhenge is the passion project of Jim Reinders, who came up with the idea to memorialize his father. Like Stonehenge, Carhenge is a glimpse of culture now past—the heyday of the American automobile. While living in England, Reinders studied Stonehenge's structure, which allowed him to replicate the formation using 39 vehicles, including cars, trucks, and even one Jeep. Reinders and about 35 family members built the attraction in June 1987. And with another nod to Stonehenge, they dedicated it on the summer solstice that same month.

Take the flat, 1.9-mile loop trail around the lakeshore for stunning views of Mount Hood. But don't stop there. Mount Hood National Forest has more than 1,200 miles of hiking trails, not to mention year-round skiing at higher elevations.

Scientists first tracked the migration of giant tortoises in the Galápagos Islands in 2013, and they’ve discovered that not only is it marvelously slow, it’s kind of erratic, and flies in the face of human understanding as to why and how most animals migrate. Only the older tortoises make the roughly 6-mile climb out of the soggy jungle up into the hills—in this case, the slopes of Alcedo Volcano on Isabela Island. The journey is loosely related to mating, but researchers think there may be many other unknown variables at play. Whatever compelled these two lumbering giants up here, in about six months, they’ll start the slow climb back down to the jungle.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jEfyJuYlaiTLpn.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TreeTower_EN-US3470966766_800x600.jpg" alt="A treetop walkway in the Bavarian Forest National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">A treetop walkway in the Bavarian Forest National Park</h2><p class="date">July 31, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This egg-shaped observation tower in Germany’s Bavarian Forest National Park is part of one of the world’s longest canopy trails—and one of the most distinctive.
