It's not an easy task—ranchers and Icelandic sheepdogs endeavor to bring the often stubborn sheep in, and then they must sort them so they go back to their respective owners. When the sheep are all secure at their home ranches, people customarily celebrate with music, dancing, drinks, and food.

Sea otters can survive on land, but they spend most of their time in the water, sleeping above the surface and anchoring themselves with kelp—or by holding onto each other.

The Fraser River flows through a showcase of this Canadian province's diverse landscape: It originates in the Rocky Mountains, carves steep valleys through central BC, and irrigates rich farmlands outside Vancouver before spilling into the sea just south of the city. The river flows gently in this stretch, as seen from the span of the Port Mann Bridge east of Vancouver, with the Golden Ears mountains in the background. Thanks to preservation efforts, the Fraser's main stem remains completely undammed, with its drainage basin covering 25% of BC's land area.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gdAvbLvoFkEbLf.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GreatBlueShark_EN-US2007599182_800x600.jpg" alt="Blue shark near the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Blue shark near the Azores in the North Atlantic Ocean</h2><p class="date">September 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This blue shark is swimming near the Azores, a Portuguese chain of islands about 850 miles west of mainland Portugal. The inspiration for the shark's name comes from its back color, which can vary from a light blue to a darker shade. Its slender, tapered body is propelled through the water with agility and grace by a long tail fin that sweeps from side to side. Listed as 'near threatened,' blue sharks are found off the coast of every continent except for Antarctica, making them the most widely distributed of all sharks. Swift and powerful swimmers, blue sharks migrate long distances. It's common for them to swim 1,200 to 1,700 miles or even farther, following the clockwise currents of the Gulf Stream in search of food, mates, and 'just right' water temperatures.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/bqbGyOzyrYfdzg.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Lavaux_EN-US2058068352_800x600.jpg" alt="Steeply terraced vineyards of the Lavaux region on the shores of Lake Geneva"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Steeply terraced vineyards of the Lavaux region on the shores of Lake Geneva</h2><p class="date">September 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The 'crush season,' aka the grape harvest, has arrived in these picturesque Swiss vineyards. The steeply terraced vineyards of the Lavaux region along Lake Geneva's northern shore produce grapes for some of the best wine in the country. The vine terraces can be traced back to the 11th century, when Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries controlled the area. A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2007, Lavaux is the largest contiguous vineyard region in Switzerland. It's known for producing Chasselas wine, a light, delicate white wine that's considered the ideal pairing with Swiss raclette cheese. Visitors enjoy hiking between the vines and wine tasting at local cellars in the villages along the lakeshore. We'll toast to that!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XKVtOkVDNaafsO.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaragangaMoth_EN-US2112895555_800x600.jpg" alt="A saturniid moth in Mole National Park in Larabanga"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">A saturniid moth in Mole National Park in Larabanga</h2><p class="date">September 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Quick!
