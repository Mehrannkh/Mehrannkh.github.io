Think again—today is Native American Heritage Day. Established in 2009, it celebrates the voices, art, and achievements of Indigenous peoples across the United States. This day is a reminder to look beyond parades and sales and learn from the experiences of those who first shaped this land. Communities host cultural events, storytelling sessions, and feasts featuring dishes like Three Sisters soup, wild rice, pemmican, beans, squash, and buffalo stew—each carrying centuries of legacy.<br><br>Among the many traditions that shine today is the concho belt. Developed by Navajo artisans in the late 1860s, these belts combine skill and style. Originally made from Mexican silver pesos melted down and formed into ingots, they are now also crafted from nickel silver or German silver. The oval discs are stamped with designs that often represent natural elements like water, the sun, or butterflies, and some are adorned with turquoise stones. More than a fashion accessory, they are symbols of identity—stories worn proudly and passed down through generations like treasured heirlooms.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202511.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./wbjJviBwpdgviD.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./mFqjElJFUlGWBo.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
