It's National Lighthouse Day, a perfect excuse to give these coastal workhorses some credit. In 1789, Congress passed a law to make sure all lighthouses were taken care of by the federal government. Whether you're a history buff, coastal explorer, or just into old engineering, today is a great day to learn more about lighthouses or visit one with your friends and family.<br><br>Like many lighthouses around the world, Florida's Gasparilla Island Lights still hold their ground. The Gasparilla Island Rear Range Light, seen in today's image, has had quite a journey. Originally assembled in Delaware, it found its forever home here in 1927 but was decommissioned by the Coast Guard in 2014. The lighthouse was restored to its former glory in 2017 and was switched on again in 2018. Today, it blinks white every six seconds. Both lights are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lighthouse grounds and museum are open to visitors seasonally, offering insights into the area's shipping past.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202508.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./yUqNFdgouzdkgG.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./fwdBRYSuAilWiJ.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
