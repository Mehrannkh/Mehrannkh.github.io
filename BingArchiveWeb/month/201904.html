Intent on getting the boat into the water, the cubs worked like they’d done this before. Lighting out onto the lake, the bears seemed to enjoy the ride.For years, scientists have known that brown bears are unusually intelligent. Observations of tool use in bears are common. Only this was something different—two cubs handling a small fishing boat like old pros. Later, the boat ran aground, and the ursine passengers exited, disappearing back into the forest.Don’t believe this story? Neither do we.

Dark-Sky Week is observed during the first new moon of April, when stars shine more brightly because the moon isn’t visible. The event was created to bring attention to the harmful effects of artificial light on the natural world, and to remind us of the beauty of an unadulterated night sky. Light pollution not only impacts our ability to see the stars and to sleep soundly, but also creates challenges for many nocturnal species, migrating birds, and even baby sea turtles.

In urban areas, trees provide unique benefits by cooling area temperatures, producing oxygen, increasing property values, and generally improving the scenery.But most trees in the United States are in forests. Roughly one-third of the country is covered by forests, and in many respects, they’re considered healthy. After centuries of forest clearing for settlement and development, total forest acreage in the US has held fairly steady for the past 100 years or so. But forests still face a variety of threats, from invasive species to disease and climate change.Given these threats, some scientists are turning to modern technology to measure forest health. For example, the experimental planting featured on our homepage today is called a Nelder plot, in which trees are planted at the intersections of concentric arcs and linear spokes. The design allows researchers to study the effects of many different planting densities in a single parcel. In another example, a company called SilviaTerra uses satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to create detailed maps of US forests that conservationists, governments, and landowners can use to develop management plans.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wOKrLqCcijIoig.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YongfuTown_EN-US7670109876_800x600.jpg" alt="Blossoming cherry trees at a tea plantation in Longyan"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Blossoming cherry trees at a tea plantation in Longyan</h2><p class="date">April 5, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today, places like this nature path in Longyan, China, will be full of families.

For example, robotic surgery allows doctors to make more precise movements than possible by a human hand. Reconnaissance robots are used by police to gather intel in situations that are too dangerous for humans. And robots are experts at rote tasks that we humans find boring, like repetitive assembly work.The robot we’re featuring today, Pepper, is designed to work directly with customers, kind of like a receptionist.

Parks around the country will be holding special programs and events through April 28, so find a park near you and enjoy these amazing places.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dYgRXkWFawUeEx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FireIce_EN-US7588914690_800x600.jpg" alt="Ice cave at sunset in Vatnajökull"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Ice cave at sunset in Vatnajökull</h2><p class="date">April 25, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It’s the first day of summer in Iceland. Known as ‘sumardagurinn fyrsti,’ this national holiday has been celebrated on the first Thursday after April 18 for centuries. The first settlers on Iceland used the Old Norse calendar, which divided the year into just two seasons. So, summer starts earlier and lasts longer in Iceland than in other countries. But then, so does winter. Today’s a cold start to summer, with temperatures in late April rarely getting above 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but conditions are good for the ice cave we’re featuring today, in Vatnajökull National Park. The Vatnajökull glacier is the largest ice cap in Europe by volume, and rests atop multiple active volcanoes. Gleðilegt sumar, Icelanders!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MJkTzSNqZBnXOx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingAloe_EN-US7990175942_800x600.jpg" alt="Hummingbird near blooming aloe plants in Laguna Beach"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hummingbird near blooming aloe plants in Laguna Beach</h2><p class="date">April 27, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The bright flowers of these aloe plants offer a striking contrast to their more recognizable green, spiky stems. Native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula, aloes—including the well-known aloe vera species—are now grown outdoors in many locations that boast mild winter climates. They can bloom at any time throughout the year. And yes, even indoor potted aloes can be encouraged to bloom with the right amount of sunlight, water, and fertilizer.Aloes, like most of the world’s flowering plants, need help with pollination, which is essential for maintaining biodiversity and our food supply. That’s where this buzzing little hummingbird comes into play. As it feeds on the aloe flowers' nectar, it pollinates the plants, too. But, broadly speaking, pollinator populations are declining, whether they’re bees, butterflies, or birds. You can help by planting a pollinator garden and avoiding pesticides, which can harm the pollinators.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tVFjwdGtTpfmJB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpringBadlands_EN-US8349424568_800x600.jpg" alt="Prairie and pinnacles near Castle Trail in Badlands National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Prairie and pinnacles near Castle Trail in Badlands National Park</h2><p class="date">April 28, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">At the close of National Park Week, we arrive at Badlands in South Dakota. Our photo today shows a view from Castle Trail—at 10 miles round trip, it’s the longest marked hike in the park. Spring rain has revived the grasses across the prairie as the sun illuminates the pinnacle rock formations in the distance. Soon, grazing animals such as bison and pronghorn will begin feasting on the fresh crop of grasses. This is also a good time of year to spot some of the dozens of different butterfly species that live in the park and provide a delicate contrast to the park’s rugged landscape.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vQevpnNLlOlTrm.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabySloth_EN-US8463078273_800x600.jpg" alt="Newborn brown-throated sloth with mother"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Newborn brown-throated sloth with mother</h2><p class="date">April 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Spring means more than just April showers and May flowers. It's also the season when many baby animals are born. The rainy, warmer days bring new plant growth, which means nursing and foraging moms can provide their newborns with larger amounts of higher-quality food. It also maximizes the 'growing season' for spring babies, giving them time to increase in size and put on fat before winter arrives.But consider our brown-throated sloth baby (and yes, a newborn sloth is called a baby). It was probably born sometime in late summer, not spring. That’s because these sloths live in the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica, which is just north of the equator, where the change in seasons isn’t as pronounced as in the higher latitudes. That means that here in the rainforest, no matter when the baby sloth is born, there will be lots of tough, rubbery leaves for the baby to eat once it stops nursing. And even though a baby sloth is fully weaned after just a few weeks, it will continue to cling to its mother’s fur for five months or more after birth.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eUIoaLsUdXfRHF.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LouisVienna_EN-US2422346599_800x600.jpg" alt="Louis Armstrong performs with bandmates in Vienna"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Louis Armstrong performs with bandmates in Vienna</h2><p class="date">April 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We’re joining the rest of the world in celebrating International Jazz Day with this 1959 image of the legendary trumpeter Louis Armstrong. Jazz music has its roots in Armstrong’s hometown of New Orleans, but it quickly spread throughout the United States before developing an international appeal and influence. April 30 is designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as International Jazz Day to highlight the music and its role in cultures around the world.This year, the day will be celebrated in more than 190 countries with educational programs, community events, and performances—including an all-star concert in Australia at Arts Centre Melbourne’s Hamer Hall. Musician Herbie Hancock, who is a UNESCO Ambassador for Intercultural Dialogue, was instrumental in starting Jazz Day. He’ll serve as co-artistic director of the 2019 show, along with trumpeter James Morrison. You can stream the concert on YouTube and Facebook—or celebrate Jazz Day by looking for a local jazz event in your area.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/twKiJiVPmMPDKR.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Pepper_EN-US7943129554_200x200.jpg" alt="Pepper"></div><div class="explore-label">Pepper</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/opBBtjfARmrQQD.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RecordStoreDay_EN-US5640323268_200x200.jpg" alt="Vinyl records in Rosmalen"></div><div class="explore-label">Vinyl records in Rosmalen</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eZzztAlWreeTVZ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NelderPlot_EN-US7412360420_200x200.jpg" alt="For Earth Month"></div><div class="explore-label">For Earth Month</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MJkTzSNqZBnXOx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BloomingAloe_EN-US7990175942_200x200.jpg" alt="Hummingbird near blooming aloe plants in Laguna Beach"></div><div class="explore-label">Hummingbird near blooming aloe plants in Laguna Beach</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/diyxxtsWbJGkGM.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YayoiTulips_EN-US6304863335_200x200.jpg" alt="Yayoi Kusama's 'With All My Love for The Tulips"></div><div class="explore-label">Yayoi Kusama's 'With All My Love for The Tulips</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
