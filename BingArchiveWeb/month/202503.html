Daylight saving time (DST) starts today at 2 AM, except in Arizona and Hawaii, reminding us that time, quite literally, waits for no one. The idea is simple: maximizing daylight and reducing energy consumption by syncing our activities with the natural light cycle. This concept was popularized by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century, though his suggestion to 'save candles' was more satirical than a serious proposal. Fast-forward to the early 20th century, when many countries adopted DST to conserve fuel during wartime. The US officially standardized it in 1966 with the Uniform Time Act.

Found across tropical southern Asia, from Iran and Sri Lanka to Indonesia and the Philippines, the black-naped monarch prefers dense forests and other lush, wooded spots. It perches upright on its short legs and spends most of its time catching insects in midair. These birds occupy the dense understory of the forest canopy.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eSBRlDdQiteeQi.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CarrizoBloom_EN-US2504669059_800x600.jpg" alt="Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Superbloom in Carrizo Plain National Monument</h2><p class="date">March 29, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It's not every day you see a desert burst into colors, but during a superbloom, arid land is covered with endless stretches of flowers. This rare phenomenon happens in California and Arizona when the rainy season awakens wildflower seeds that have been lying dormant in the soil. Superblooms in California typically occur once a decade, but prolonged droughts in the 21st century have made them increasingly less frequent. Drawing attention to California's diverse flora and rural federal lands, this event offers a temporary boost to local economies.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/fBfOYlHsZzLvcr.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SydneyHarbour_EN-US2885246621_800x600.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Sydney Harbour"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Aerial view of Sydney Harbour</h2><p class="date">March 30, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today's photo features a spot in Sydney, Australia, where shimmery waters meet famous landmarks: Port Jackson, more commonly known as Sydney Harbour. In the center, we have a bird's-eye view of the Sydney Opera House, an architectural icon with sail-like shells that shine bright under the Australian sun. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World Heritage Site took 14 years to complete and hosts over 1,500 performances annually. Just across the harbor, on the left side of the picture, the Sydney Harbour Bridge—affectionately called 'the Coathanger' for its arching steel frame—connects the city's northern and southern shores. When it opened in 1932, it was the world's widest long-span bridge. Adventurous visitors can climb its 440-foot summit for breathtaking panoramic views.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/SJqQrWaTTFdTyV.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ItalyOstuni_EN-US2964422003_800x600.jpg" alt="Ostuni at dusk"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Ostuni at dusk</h2><p class="date">March 31, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Perched on a hilltop overlooking the Adriatic Sea, there is a historic city that enchants visitors with its labyrinth of whitewashed buildings, winding alleyways, and a sun-drenched piazza.
