In many British Commonwealth countries, today is known as Boxing Day, a holiday that originated in the United Kingdom. There are a few conflicting theories about its origins, but it's generally accepted that the name derives from the giving of 'boxes' to lower classes on the day after Christmas. One thing is certain—it has nothing to do with pugilism, although it has primarily become a day dedicated to sporting events and shopping, much like the Friday after Thanksgiving in the US.<br><br>Many families also use the holiday as an opportunity to go outside and get some exercise after spending Christmas Day indoors, like these ice skaters in our homepage image. They're gliding across the Royal Pavilion Ice Rink in Brighton, on the southern coast of England. The ice rink, set in front of a royal pleasure palace built for King George IV, is said to be the only one of its kind in the UK powered entirely by green energy. It is located within Brighton's bustling North Laine district, a popular shopping area that is sure to be busy today. As you shop for bargains and enjoy those tasty turkey leftovers, consider paying homage to Boxing Day's origins by helping those who are less fortunate.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202112.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./XHtOGQhNPuWmLb.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./pHMnqcgWBgHgbu.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
