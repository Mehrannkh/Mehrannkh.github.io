Known locally as Casa do Penedo (House of the Rock), its prehistoric appearance has drawn comparisons to the Flintstones' dwelling in the fictional town of Bedrock. But the secluded stone structure on our homepage is very much real—it was built as a rural retreat in the Portuguese countryside in the 1970s. The building is sandwiched between four boulders that serve as the foundation, walls, and ceiling of the house, blending in as part of the beautiful natural landscape.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aRqJKbauJcoiNp.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Mpumalanga_EN-US2361653913_800x600.jpg" alt="Red-billed oxpeckers on an impala in Mpumalanga"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Red-billed oxpeckers on an impala in Mpumalanga</h2><p class="date">August 28, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">By posing for us, are these red-billed oxpeckers imposing on the impala? Well, science hasn't quite decided on this one. The relationship between parasite-eating birds and hoofed mammals was once considered a textbook example of mutualism, with oxpeckers cleaning up the ticks and fleas that bug the bigger beasts. Which is what we'd like to think is going on here.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HSIChqwIqtrGHh.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Ruskeala_EN-US2421855092_800x600.jpg" alt="Underground lake in Ruskeala Mountain Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Underground lake in Ruskeala Mountain Park</h2><p class="date">August 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Ruskeala Mountain Park is an eerily beautiful reminder of the booming mining industry that thrived for centuries in this area of Russia near the border with Finland. Located on the site of an abandoned marble quarry, the park opened to the public in 2005. The centuries-old quarry has been flooded with groundwater since the end of World War II, although some old buildings and kilns from the mines are still intact.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pcVsmlgDfCgvcB.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MayonVolcano_EN-US2517637729_800x600.jpg" alt="Crater glow from Mount Mayon in the Philippines"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Crater glow from Mount Mayon in the Philippines</h2><p class="date">August 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">How far would you have to travel for the 'perfect cone'? Well, probably not too far if you're talking ice cream. But if volcanoes are what you're looking for, you'll have to make your way to Mount Mayon on the Philippine island of Luzon. The glowing lava you see is on the tip of what many consider to be the world's most perfectly shaped, symmetrical volcanic cone. Mount Mayon has erupted dozens of times in the past 400 years, and there was a significant eruption as recently as 2018. Even this year, white steam plumes and a faint crater glow are sometimes visible. Mayon is the most active volcano in an island nation full of active volcanos. It's located inside the UNESCO Albay Biosphere Reserve as well as in the Philippine's Mayon Volcano Natural Park. Despite its active status, tourists still flock to the park to view the unique beauty of this cone-shaped spectacle.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vNeGpLfBZcHiPt.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DjurdjevicaBridge_EN-US2627065806_800x600.jpg" alt="Đurđevića Tara Bridge in Montenegro"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Đurđevića Tara Bridge in Montenegro</h2><p class="date">August 31, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In northern Montenegro, the Đurđevića Tara Bridge is the fastest passage between the villages of Budečevica and Trešnjica. The five-arch concrete bridge was completed in 1940 just as World War II was spreading across Europe. By 1941, Italian forces from the Axis powers had invaded this region. Local guerrilla fighters took an extreme measure to keep the Italian army from crossing the Tara River Valley: They blew up one of the arches, making the bridge unpassable and slowing the advancement of the invading forces. The bridge was rebuilt in 1946, and though it retains its original name, some still call it the anti-fascist bridge. And now you know an awesome story about a bridge in Montenegro.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/cCYjzHYDrCrUYw.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LittleBlueHeron_EN-US0980028207_200x200.jpg" alt="Little blue heron in Cuba"></div><div class="explore-label">Little blue heron in Cuba</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RQRSnSuYXTUZfG.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRoofTile_EN-US7950086465_200x200.jpg" alt="The Old Town of Dubrovnik"></div><div class="explore-label">The Old Town of Dubrovnik</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aNmuSevmFCjLIW.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WalhallaOverlook_EN-US3794328028_200x200.jpg" alt="Peekaboo view of Angels Window on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon"></div><div class="explore-label">Peekaboo view of Angels Window on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vNeGpLfBZcHiPt.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.DjurdjevicaBridge_EN-US2627065806_200x200.jpg" alt="Đurđevića Tara Bridge in Montenegro"></div><div class="explore-label">Đurđevića Tara Bridge in Montenegro</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lnWpcGyuHiTRFG.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FlintstoneHouse_EN-US2289408745_200x200.jpg" alt="Casa do Penedo (House of the Rock) in Portugal"></div><div class="explore-label">Casa do Penedo (House of the Rock) in Portugal</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
