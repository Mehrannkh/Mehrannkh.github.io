Passed in the US in 1973, this law was a game-changer, ensuring that economic growth wouldn't steamroll over species at risk of disappearing forever. For the first time, plants were given protection too, and the focus shifted from merely avoiding extinction to actively helping species recover to the point where they could thrive without protection.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BgUGYHtzbWFGMD.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BorobudurBells_EN-US6354350828_800x600.jpg" alt="Borobudur Temple"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Borobudur Temple</h2><p class="date">December 29, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Imagine a colossal puzzle made from over 2 million stone blocks—that's Borobudur, seen in today's image. Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nADnmpEZAOYryu.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountFieldNP_EN-US6905459745_800x600.jpg" alt="Tasmanian snow gum and pandani plants near Lake Dobson"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Tasmanian snow gum and pandani plants near Lake Dobson</h2><p class="date">December 30, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">At the heart of Tasmania, an island state off the southeastern coast of Australia, lies Mount Field National Park. Covering more than 60 square miles, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges 190 feet.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aAZNIbSeBCMOft.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RioNewYear_EN-US7216341802_800x600.jpg" alt="New Year's Eve fireworks over Copacabana Beach"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">New Year's Eve fireworks over Copacabana Beach</h2><p class="date">December 31, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks, and for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life, and good fortune for the coming year, and many people sing the Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' at the stroke of midnight in remembrance of old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby in a tradition that dates back to ancient Greeks, and paired with an old man who represents the year that is ending.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/nADnmpEZAOYryu.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountFieldNP_EN-US6905459745_200x200.jpg" alt="Tasmanian snow gum and pandani plants near Lake Dobson"></div><div class="explore-label">Tasmanian snow gum and pandani plants near Lake Dobson</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/KNzGGaRRBgoCKz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MisurinaLake_EN-US7921587884_200x200.jpg" alt="Lake Misurina"></div><div class="explore-label">Lake Misurina</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FqIdHbptjiqwHq.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SibiuRomania_EN-US9223739756_200x200.jpg" alt="Christmas market in Sibiu"></div><div class="explore-label">Christmas market in Sibiu</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/gRHAJCwFjRtKgT.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FestivusCranes_EN-US0396321898_200x200.jpg" alt="Red-crowned cranes in Kushiro"></div><div class="explore-label">Red-crowned cranes in Kushiro</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pykyRpXDIAXutF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LakeBledSnow_EN-US5836531079_200x200.jpg" alt="Lake Bled"></div><div class="explore-label">Lake Bled</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
