Not because it was faulty but because the attendance rates far exceeded capacity. Built to hold 800 people safely at any given time, daily attendance was expected to be around 8,000. When 80,000 visitors showed up each day after it opened, authorities needed some time to reevaluate what exactly they had. Parking, ticketing, and customer service were boosted before the bridge reopened.<br><br>Designed by Israeli architect Haim Dotan, it was always meant for tourists. Spanning 1,410 feet across the canyon between two mountain cliffs in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, more than 120 glass panels allow unparalleled views 980 feet straight down. Should you feel daring, you could swing underneath the bridge or take the plunge from the world's highest bungee jump. Management touts that the bridge set 10 world records for design and construction, and when it opened it was the longest bridge of its kind in the world. That honor has since passed to the bridge at the Huangchuan Three Gorges Scenic Area in China's Guangdong province, which spans 1,726 feet.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202205.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./GikOqeEYqVRTfF.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./eVmistipLkVVcx.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
