The star of the show? The tiny Bled Island, which beckons with the promise of legends and 'rowmance.' Make your way there on a traditional, flat-bottomed pletna boat, piloted by oarsmen whose skills have been handed down through generations since 1740. The island is home to the 17th-century Assumption of Mary Church, with its special bell that, legend says, will make wishes come true. If you look to the shore directly above the island in our image, you can spot Bled Castle overlooking the lake's expanse.

The city is often referred to as the most haunted in America, so devotees to all things spooky head here to test their nerves. A cemetery since 1846, the 160-acre site is perched on a bluff overlooking the Wilmington River. Its oak trees, dripping with Spanish moss, loom over walkways, monuments, and elaborate burial vaults. If it sounds like stepping into a southern Gothic novel, you're on the right track: The cemetery featured in John Berendt's 1994 bestseller 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.' Among the famous figures resting here is poet Conrad Aiken, whose grave is mentioned in the novel. His tombstone is a bench, said to have been designed to allow poetry lovers somewhere to sit to enjoy a drink in these soul-stirring surroundings.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ekYlEavwzknimQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AutumnRaven_EN-US0686194098_800x600.jpg" alt="Common raven sitting on a branch"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Common raven sitting on a branch</h2><p class="date">October 30, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The common raven is an intelligent bird whose keen eyesight and agility make it a proficient hunter.
