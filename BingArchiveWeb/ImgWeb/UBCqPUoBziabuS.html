Otters are nature's playful pranksters, but their future isn't all smooth sailing. Many species are threatened by habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal wildlife trade. But it doesn't have to be that way. On World Otter Day—the last Wednesday of May—let's shine a light on the challenges these lovable mammals face and help protect their place in the wild.<br><br>Otters belong to the Mustelidae family, a diverse group that includes weasels, badgers, and minks, and are found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. With 13 species worldwide, including the European otter, giant otter, and sea otter—pictured here—these semi-aquatic animals are adapted for life in water. Their webbed feet, dense fur, and strong tails make them excellent swimmers. Beyond their cuteness, otters play a vital role in ecosystems. As top predators in freshwater and coastal habitats, they help maintain healthy fish populations and keep aquatic environments balanced. Without otters, food chains could become unstable, leading to ecological problems. Whether it's through education, conservation efforts, or simply spreading the word, every action helps keep them afloat.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202505.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./bUicyDPbIkPvkt.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./QSMbboFcCRTtpx.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
