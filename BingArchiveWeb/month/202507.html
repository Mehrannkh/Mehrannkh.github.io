Canada Day is a nod to the moment when the country officially came together in 1867. What began as a confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia has grown into a nation of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Originally called Dominion Day, the name was changed to Canada Day in 1982—the same year the Constitution Act was signed, granting the country full control over its constitution. While Canada Day is not the country's 'Independence Day,' it's the closest thing to it. Canadians celebrate this holiday with fireworks, parades, concerts, and community events. Ottawa, the country's capital, hosts one of the biggest celebrations, featuring music and speeches on Parliament Hill.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HYANaRSoHwcNnC.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaroonClownfish_EN-US0391262783_800x600.jpg" alt="Spine-cheeked anemonefish surrounded by bubble-tip anemone"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Spine-cheeked anemonefish surrounded by bubble-tip anemone</h2><p class="date">July 2, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">That bright fish hiding in the anemone?

Quite a lot, actually. Celebrated every July 30, the International Day of Friendship reminds us that tackling global challenges, like poverty, violence, and injustice, starts with something surprisingly simple: human connection. That's exactly what artist Saype had in mind with 'Beyond Walls,' a series of massive, biodegradable land-art murals featuring interlinked hands. Symbolizing unity and solidarity, these works have stretched across five continents. At Expo 2020 Dubai, Saype's 11th installation covered over 16,000 square feet of grass in Al Forsan Park. It formed a striking black-and-white handshake that could only be fully appreciated from above, as seen here. The piece, made with eco-friendly paint, was unveiled on Switzerland's National Day, supported by the Swiss Pavilion.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nWpvCNidFYinIN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BabyLemur_EN-US9264861498_800x600.jpg" alt="Ring-tailed lemur infant playing with its own tail"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Ring-tailed lemur infant playing with its own tail</h2><p class="date">July 31, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It looks like this small creature is playing a game, right? But when a baby ring-tailed lemur wraps its tail around or gives it a tug, it's actually working on crucial skills. The infants spend their early weeks hanging tight to their mom, first clinging to her belly, and later to her back. As they grow, they separate from their mom, and tail-chasing becomes part of how they learn balance, coordination, and group play. These primates use their long tails for communication as well. Raised like flags during group movement, the tails help them stick together in open terrain. Loud, rhythmic calls, scent markings, and 'stink fights' between males add to the social drama.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/WNjCIxrkDPLQef.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MongoliaYurts_EN-US1803457525_200x200.jpg" alt="Yurts in the grasslands of Mongolia"></div><div class="explore-label">Yurts in the grasslands of Mongolia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qWFPOjkWHVMnSV.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MothWeek_EN-US5360572836_200x200.jpg" alt="Luna moth resting on cedar elm"></div><div class="explore-label">Luna moth resting on cedar elm</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/uGVKqftINyKYjq.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaDayFogo_EN-US0231478181_200x200.jpg" alt="Fishing village of Tilting"></div><div class="explore-label">Fishing village of Tilting</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nggRIVzjJfpfxb.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RainbowRiver_EN-US0442967532_200x200.jpg" alt="Rainbow River in Rainbow Springs State Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Rainbow River in Rainbow Springs State Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/TxTdUuDAHjdPOJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SecedaPeak_EN-US0983713623_200x200.jpg" alt="Seceda"></div><div class="explore-label">Seceda</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
