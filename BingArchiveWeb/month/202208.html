This view of the volcano shows how the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, ripped apart the once-conical summit, forever changing the Washington landscape. Forty years ago today, 110,000 acres within Gifford Pinchot National Forest were set aside to memorialize the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the United States.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vdLjDSONNuhhrx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BeardedTit_EN-US6692547915_800x600.jpg" alt="Bearded reedlings at a wetland in Flevoland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Bearded reedlings at a wetland in Flevoland</h2><p class="date">August 28, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Flevoland, the 12th and newest province in the Netherlands, has only been around since 1986. Not only was it not established until this late date, but before the mid-20th century, much of the land here simply didn't exist. Flevoland was created through vast land reclamation projects in the 1950s and '60s. While the Dutch had been reforming their landscape to meet their changing needs for hundreds of years, the 20th century would see their most dramatic and ambitious projects realized. The province's anthem is the fitting 'Waar Wij Steden Doen Verrijzen' ('Where We Let Cities Arise'). It's an ode to pushing back the sea and creating a 'province that's not bad, youngest part of the Netherlands. Where it is nice to live, my beloved Flevoland!'</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/PcQuOdEnPeiGSf.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EstoniaBaltic_EN-US6923966670_800x600.jpg" alt="Baltic Sea in Estonia"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Baltic Sea in Estonia</h2><p class="date">August 29, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Baltic Sea in northeast Europe is a peculiar body of water, combining the characteristics of a sea with those of a lake and an estuary, too. Strictly speaking, it is in fact a sea and thus appropriately named, joined to the Atlantic Ocean through three straits in Denmark: the Öresund, Great Belt, and Little Belt. Technically, the Baltic is classified as a brackish sea, meaning it is not entirely fresh and not entirely saline. The Baltic Sea isn't landlocked, but it does border many countries, including Russia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—and it's the Estonian coast featured in today's image.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FechLJCwUvfxHn.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Migliarino_EN-US6999892958_800x600.jpg" alt="Regional Park of Migliarino"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Regional Park of Migliarino</h2><p class="date">August 30, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This idyllic road is a path to one of Italy's magnificent natural gifts.

A wide array of birds can also be found in the park, along with ample wild boar, rabbits, red foxes, and the impressively antlered fallow deer.

Oftentimes it's found anchored to or hiding under rocks. This duo was spotted near the coast of New Ireland, an island in Papua New Guinea. Even though 'blue' is in the name, this species of sea star has also been observed in purple, pink, or orange. The vibrant colors make the linckia popular in the seashell trade, unfortunately, and intensive poaching has diminished their populations. But new research could lead to calls for their protection: Scientists have studied potential anti-tumor and antibacterial properties inherent to the blue linckia.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/ybzJViqdLnavXz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TenderMoment_EN-US3269942524_200x200.jpg" alt="A burrowing owl chick and adult in South Florida"></div><div class="explore-label">A burrowing owl chick and adult in South Florida</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ktqAiDmYDcEPuQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PantherChameleon_EN-US2150362477_200x200.jpg" alt="Panther chameleon in Amber Mountain National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Panther chameleon in Amber Mountain National Park</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/UKmnvYFsDKaNcy.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CuevaManos_EN-US2810052050_200x200.jpg" alt="Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands) in Santa Cruz"></div><div class="explore-label">Cueva de las Manos (Cave of the Hands) in Santa Cruz</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FechLJCwUvfxHn.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Migliarino_EN-US6999892958_200x200.jpg" alt="Regional Park of Migliarino"></div><div class="explore-label">Regional Park of Migliarino</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GQVPErCwoxWyKF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BangladeshWaterLilies_EN-US1994505786_200x200.jpg" alt="Farmers collecting water lilies in the Satla marshland near Bagdha"></div><div class="explore-label">Farmers collecting water lilies in the Satla marshland near Bagdha</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
