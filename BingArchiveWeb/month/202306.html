Sadly, climate change and pollution threaten this iconic site, the largest reef in the world. On June 1, we observe World Reef Awareness Day to remind people of the importance of safeguarding coral reefs, which provide food and shelter for about 25% of all marine life, to maintain the balance of nature.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cZUgoRWSzlOtcz.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GemsbokNamibia_EN-US7844189674_800x600.jpg" alt="Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) in sand dunes"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) in sand dunes</h2><p class="date">June 2, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">To quote Jurassic Park's Dr. Malcolm: 'Life, uh, finds a way.'

Also known as the oryx, it is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, especially around the Namib and Kalahari deserts. The gemsbok does not need to drink much water, instead finding hydration in the vegetation it grazes upon—including wild tsamma melons and cucumbers.
