It is part of Tricity—a metropolitan area along the Gdańsk Bay that includes the neighboring coastal cities of Sopot and Gdynia, along with nearby towns. The city likely takes its name from 'Gdania,' an earlier name for the Motława river that runs through it.<br><br>The city originated as a Slavic fort in the late 10th century and was first recorded in 997, when it came under the early influence of the Polish state. Over the centuries, Gdańsk has experienced Polish, German, and independent rule, each leaving a mark on the region's identity. The Main City draws most visitors, especially to the lively promenade that runs along Ulica Długa (Long Street) and Długi Targ (Long Market). Flanked by decorative gates and lined with stately townhouses rebuilt in 17th-century style, this pedestrian stretch is steeped in charm. Once the ceremonial path for Polish royalty, it's now fondly known as the Royal Route. The path unfolds like a living museum, dotted with historic landmarks like the Highland Gate, Amber Museum, Uphagen's House, Main Town Hall, Neptune's Fountain, and the grand Artus Court.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202509.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./xAitsCwheXWMms.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./uZyOpQzuiuARFn.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
