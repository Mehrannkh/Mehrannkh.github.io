Today, we honor those who dedicate their lives to sharing knowledge and shaping minds. Happy World Teachers' Day to all the educators who have helped us become who we are.<br><br>From Confucius in ancient China to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle in ancient Greece, and Maria Montessori in 20th-century Italy, teachers have not only shaped lives—they've shaped history. Many cultural icons once stood at the front of a classroom. Did you know that Stephen King, for instance, taught English before becoming a bestselling author?<br><br>Teachers are essential pillars of a thriving society. Recognizing this, UNESCO and the International Labour Organization established October 5 as World Teachers' Day in 1994 to celebrate and support educators worldwide. As a tribute to wisdom, today's image features a boreal owl. The owl has long symbolized intelligence and insight. One of the earliest associations comes from Greek mythology: the goddess of wisdom, Athena, was often depicted with a small owl, her sacred animal. This nocturnal companion came to represent clarity, perception, and the ability to see beyond the surface.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202510.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./JosXVwvYQNtLXT.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./mkqyFtrSFHtSCC.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
