Constructed between 1876 and 1887, the Lick Observatory has been the site of significant discoveries, including several of Jupiter's moons and other planetary systems. It's named for American real-estate entrepreneur James Lick, who set aside $700,000 for the University of California to build a facility that would be home to a 'telescope superior to and more powerful than any telescope yet made.'<br><br>His wish came true. The 36-inch refracting telescope on Mount Hamilton was the largest that had ever been built when it saw first light on January 3, 1888, a distinction it held until the construction of the 40-inch refractor at Wisconsin's Yerkes Observatory in 1897. Sadly, Lick died before his vision became a reality, but his name lives on. His body is even buried beneath the telescope, which continues to scan the skies today.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202201.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./LcsGToTcMRToxm.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./GxMtEyoBtwddjb.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
