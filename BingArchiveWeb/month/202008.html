The village is still there, but in 1632, Carlo III, an Italian royal, commissioned the construction of a large palazzo (palace) on the island. The ostentatious palace includes a model Italian garden.

The briny bivalves may be grown on beds, rods, racks, or—in this case—ropes, but the basic process is simple: Growing surfaces are 'seeded' with whole or ground oyster shells before oyster larvae are introduced. The shells attract the larvae, which attach themselves and soon grow into a new layer of mature oysters.

Or did it? Not only is Death Valley one of the hottest places on Earth, it also boasts a mysterious geologic phenomenon—rocks that drift across the exceptionally flat desert floor, seemingly under their own power. The rocks here at Death Valley's Racetrack Playa are known as 'sailing stones' and they can vary in size from a few ounces to hundreds of pounds.  As seen in our image, the stones leave long trails behind them as they move across the scenic dry lakebed.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cELTMzKskElZSP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MonteCristo_EN-US3353853394_800x600.jpg" alt="Château d'If in Marseille"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Château d'If in Marseille</h2><p class="date">August 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Château d'If, off the coast of Marseille, France, was built beginning in 1524 as a fortress by King Francis I. The tiny islet in the Mediterranean Sea was chosen as the site for the fortress because of its steep cliffs and strategic location near the busy port of Marseille. While the 'château' never gained fame defending the ancient port (since it was never attacked), it did become notorious as a prison. Surrounded by treacherous currents—like Alcatraz in San Francisco—starting in the late 16th century it was a dumping ground for political and religious prisoners. As far as official records go, none of the prisoners condemned there ever escaped.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IIkAnJFpceFeDW.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BicycleSculptures_EN-US3449807795_800x600.jpg" alt="Bicycle sculptures at the Col d'Aubisque"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Bicycle sculptures at the Col d'Aubisque</h2><p class="date">August 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're high in the French Pyrenees at the Col d'Aubisque, a beautiful mountain pass topping out at 5,607 feet above sea level. The Col d'Aubisque is one of the legendary climbs of the Tour de France, which starts today in Nice. The grueling bicycle race lasts 23 days (21 days of racing), with riders clocking around 2,200 miles overall, and this mountain pass is often one of its most challenging stages. The road up the pass has grades in either direction that can tilt past 10%. This epic mountain stage was first added to the 1910 race and it's since appeared in more than half the annual Tours, though not this year as it happens.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EChGAnEOwYaplJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MakeHay_EN-US3538917204_800x600.jpg" alt="Hay bales in a field in Jutland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hay bales in a field in Jutland</h2><p class="date">August 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Whenever summer turns to autumn, the hay harvest is at the front of farmers' minds. To mark the change of season, we're ambling through a hayfield full of beautifully rolled bales. This particular pastoral patch is in Jutland, the agrarian mainland of Denmark that 'juts' into the North Sea. But if you could—hay presto—snap your fingers and teleport to any hayfield at sunset, you'd surely see similar neat rows of dry, amber-tinted grass.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/uaJeDzkCSOFsge.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PRNLCavern_EN-US7693319589_800x600.jpg" alt="Cavern in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Cavern in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior</h2><p class="date">August 31, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We're looking out from a cavern at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The area's named for its colorful sandstone cliffs, which stretch for 15 miles along the shores of the largest of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior. As groundwater leaches out of the rocks, it carries minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper that paint the cliffs in shades of red, pink, black, green, and other colors. The park itself, which is roughly the size of five Manhattans, boasts waterfalls, beaches, and rock formations—some resembling human profiles and castle turrets—carved over time by relentless waves and the unforgiving weather of Yooper Country.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/EChGAnEOwYaplJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MakeHay_EN-US3538917204_200x200.jpg" alt="Hay bales in a field in Jutland"></div><div class="explore-label">Hay bales in a field in Jutland</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/uaJeDzkCSOFsge.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PRNLCavern_EN-US7693319589_200x200.jpg" alt="Cavern in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior"></div><div class="explore-label">Cavern in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/meMOZvnWSTJNUd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PancakeRocks_EN-US1220361824_200x200.jpg" alt="The Tasman Sea from Punakaiki on South Island"></div><div class="explore-label">The Tasman Sea from Punakaiki on South Island</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QrQDMrPILlbJno.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TRex_EN-US7513536381_200x200.jpg" alt="Fossil skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex"></div><div class="explore-label">Fossil skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/yZEdpNKfPdObgm.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PhotographyEmperor_EN-US7865787520_200x200.jpg" alt="A group of curious emperor penguins in Antarctica"></div><div class="explore-label">A group of curious emperor penguins in Antarctica</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
