Tree frogs are smaller than your average terrestrial frogs because they spend the majority of their lives perched in trees, and their weight must be fully supported by twigs and leaves. At the rounded ends of their froggy fingers and toes are disc-shaped adhesive pads that help them to maneuver about on trees. While most tree frogs (there are 800 species all over the world!) are green, brown, or gray, these Javans are bright and colorful. This is so they can blend into their jungle environs and avoid notice by predators such as snakes, spiders, bats, and owls.<br><br>Each of these frogs went through a complete metamorphosis, starting out as one of about 50 eggs in a clutch nestled in foam. Tree frog mothers tend to lay their eggs on the leaves of branches hanging over streams, ponds, or lakes. When the eggs hatch, the tadpoles then drop into the water below. The tadpoles mature into frogs and end up hanging out with their frog cousins on limbs like this one.
