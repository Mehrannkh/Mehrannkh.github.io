What you see at Arches National Park in Utah, is the result of over 300 million years of erosion, uplift, and weathering. Over time, layers of sandstone cracked, shifted, and slowly wore away, revealing more than 2,000 natural arches. The formations are made mostly of Entrada and Navajo sandstone. The area was recognized as a national monument in 1929 and was upgraded to national park status in 1971.<br><br>The distinctive shape of Delicate Arch, seen here, has made it one of the most recognizable natural arches in the Southwest. Originally known by several other names—including the Chaps and Salt Wash Arch—it wasn't officially called Delicate Arch until the 1930s. It is Utah's unofficial mascot, appearing on everything from state license plates to a US postage stamp issued in 1996 to mark 100 years of Utah statehood. The arch is accessible via a moderately difficult hike that climbs over bare rock and skirts steep drop-offs. Whether you're a geology enthusiast or simply looking for a view worth the effort, Delicate Arch delivers.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202506.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./jHetEVIBCrvyQX.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./ETjosDJvNsKSBr.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
