In a bid to scale the tallest peaks and conquer difficult terrain around the world, mountain climbers embark on physically strenuous journeys that demand exceptional training and experience. But the panoramic views and sense of achievement after reaching the summit makes the effort worthwhile. Our image today is that of Denali, North America's highest peak at 20,310 feet, in south-central Alaska. The name 'Denali' means 'the high one' in the native Athabascan language. Four climbers, Walter Harper, Harry Karstens, Robert Tatum, and Hudson Stuck, were the first to set foot on the top of the mountain in 1913.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/sGKMdBALsDvGPJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CapitolButte_EN-US2124222699_800x600.jpg" alt="Sandstone butte in Capitol Reef National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Sandstone butte in Capitol Reef National Park</h2><p class="date">August 2, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Behold the rugged grandeur of Utah's red rock country.

For centuries it flourished as the Republic of Ragusa, maintaining independence through diplomacy and robust trade networks. This 'Pearl of the Adriatic' has withstood military bombardments and devastating earthquakes, yet the city has always rebuilt and persevered. While pop culture, history, and UNESCO World Heritage Site status are all big draws, they might be too effective: A recent report estimated that in 2019 there were 36 tourists for every resident.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RAwgqQfctKbiRO.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TetonBison_EN-US5358590688_800x600.jpg" alt="American bison in Grand Teton National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">American bison in Grand Teton National Park</h2><p class="date">August 29, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The bison is a majestic, massive creature, a true emblem of the American frontier spirit. These sturdy animals roamed North America's prairies for thousands of years in numbers estimated to be as high as 60 million. But settlement of the American West caused habitat loss, and that, combined with overhunting, nearly wiped out the species altogether by the end of the 19th century. Ranchers, conservationists, Native American tribes, and politicians worked to save the bison and today, nearly 500,000 bison can be found in North America. About 15,000 animals are in free-roaming herds that graze on US public lands, like the bison in today's image, shown at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/rvAVnKRoOclXzL.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NingalooShark_EN-US2673625094_800x600.jpg" alt="Whale shark"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Whale shark</h2><p class="date">August 30, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Say hello to the largest fish in the world, the whale shark. On August 30, we celebrate International Whale Shark Day to honor these magnificent marine creatures. These gentle giants are not related to whales, despite their impressive size—they can reach up to 40 feet in length. Whale sharks are calm creatures which are usually safe for divers to swim alongside. These sharks are filter feeders and consume plankton and small fish by sieving them through their gill plates. There has been a significant decline in their populations, with an estimated 63% decrease in their numbers in the last 75 years. Threats include being hit by boats or tangled in fishing gear and their habitats are being damaged by pollution, coastal development and over-fishing. Advocates work through education and community engagement to help safeguard whale sharks and preserve our oceans.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eOAJyaLCCIhrnx.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IronwoodCactus_EN-US2823371711_800x600.jpg" alt="Saguaro cacti"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Saguaro cacti</h2><p class="date">August 31, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Massive succulents against a mountainous backdrop, underneath the sun-kissed Arizona sky—it's prickly perfection. Pictured here are saguaro (pronounced 'sah-wah-roh') cacti at the Ironwood Forest National Monument in the Sonoran Desert. Even if you haven't seen one in person, when you hear the word cactus, you're probably thinking of saguaro—tall, green, cylindrical, with arms pointing upward. From tattoos to coffee cups, you'll find this iconic symbol of Arizona on almost everything. Though they are slow growers, these plants have been known to live over 200 years and reach enormous heights, with a 78-footer setting the record. Another cactus, known as 'Grandaddy,' survived in the sweltering desert for about 300 years, eventually succumbing to old age in the early 1990s. Cacti may not be for everyone, but they tend to grow on you (figuratively, of course)!</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/QCZdSqtwhvKxXF.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.InfinityTaipei_EN-US3008697284_200x200.jpg" alt="Highways in Taipei"></div><div class="explore-label">Highways in Taipei</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/eOAJyaLCCIhrnx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.IronwoodCactus_EN-US2823371711_200x200.jpg" alt="Saguaro cacti"></div><div class="explore-label">Saguaro cacti</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/dftZmYqrRfRrpa.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YellowstoneFalls_EN-US1964232839_200x200.jpg" alt="Lower Yellowstone Falls"></div><div class="explore-label">Lower Yellowstone Falls</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ufbhsvMqyLycIL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EmeraldLakeYukon_EN-US0522450551_200x200.jpg" alt="Emerald Lake"></div><div class="explore-label">Emerald Lake</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RAwgqQfctKbiRO.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TetonBison_EN-US5358590688_200x200.jpg" alt="American bison in Grand Teton National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">American bison in Grand Teton National Park</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
