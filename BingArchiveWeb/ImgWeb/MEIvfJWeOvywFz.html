This mining camp became a booming gold rush town in the 1870s, after a cave-in revealed a rich vein of gold. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay.<br><br>Today, Bodie is one of America's best-preserved ghost towns. Wandering through the streets, you can peer into dusty homes and storefronts, and even find small artifacts like shards of china and square nails from the glory days. Legend has it that Bodie's ghosts fiercely guard the town, and those who take souvenirs risk being cursed with bad luck. Taking items home is also strictly against the park's rules. So, be sure to leave with nothing but memories—lest the town's spirits follow you home.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202410.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./zzhlTVpTTGbnTN.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./KzAQZclVfoZims.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
