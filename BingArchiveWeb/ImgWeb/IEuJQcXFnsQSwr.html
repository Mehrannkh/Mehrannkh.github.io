Built in the 13th century, this castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was once a stronghold of the MacDonnells of Antrim, a branch of the Clan MacDonnell that played a key role in Irish politics from the 15th to the 17th century. The family's fortunes declined after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, and with little money for upkeep, the castle gradually fell into ruin.<br><br>Dunluce Castle is steeped in legend, including the tale of its banshee. Maeve Roe, the only daughter of Lord MacQuillan, defied an arranged marriage and was locked away in the castle's turret. One night, as Maeve Roe and her lover fled by boat, a fierce storm struck, dragging them both to a watery grave. Locals say her ghostly cries still echo from the turret. Today, visitors can explore the windswept remains of this medieval fortress, imagining the feasts and battles that once took place here. And if the castle itself isn't impressive enough, the views over the Causeway Coast certainly are.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202505.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./yzCzIqkTbdDiuK.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./uxnUwVwMwTJzUM.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
