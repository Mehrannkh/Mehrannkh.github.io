In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano in Italian). As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ksoyuxsgiSCVkl.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HoodoosBryce_EN-US6434628044_800x600.jpg" alt="Hoodoos"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hoodoos</h2><p class="date">July 31, 2024</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Let's take a trip to a forest of stones. Sunset Point, seen in today's image, offers sweeping views of the hoodoos of Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park. These rock formations are created by frost weathering and stream erosion, which shape the stone into an otherworldly landscape. Perched at 8,000 to 9,000 feet, this overlook offers a panoramic view of rocky spires in red, orange, and white. The most iconic of them is Thor's Hammer, a hoodoo that overlooks a part of the park known as the 'Silent City.' The Queen's Garden Trail, which leads from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, offers even more vistas and rock formations, including the Queen Victoria hoodoo. According to the legend told by the Paiute Indigenous people who inhabited this area, hoodoos are people who have been turned to stone for their misdeeds by the trickster Coyote. Whether you're a hiker, a photographer, or simply a traveler, the hoodoos are waiting.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/VAXJjqPiHuGvap.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GangiSicily_EN-US5325083744_200x200.jpg" alt="Gangi"></div><div class="explore-label">Gangi</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EMGDBYXqvixtcJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HudsonFireworks_EN-US4304057228_200x200.jpg" alt="Fireworks over the Hudson River on the Fourth of July"></div><div class="explore-label">Fireworks over the Hudson River on the Fourth of July</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DIwggbmaQmYXUj.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LaGeriaLanzarote_EN-US4849523931_200x200.jpg" alt="Volcanic vineyard in the La Geria wine region of Lanzarote"></div><div class="explore-label">Volcanic vineyard in the La Geria wine region of Lanzarote</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tTmYOzaxrZIyta.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CappadociaRocks_EN-US8162611189_200x200.jpg" alt="Fairy chimneys and cave dwellings in Cappadocia"></div><div class="explore-label">Fairy chimneys and cave dwellings in Cappadocia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mQdInhzXRMZGZS.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SheepCousins_EN-US9566915151_200x200.jpg" alt="Flock of Swaledale sheep in North Yorkshire"></div><div class="explore-label">Flock of Swaledale sheep in North Yorkshire</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
