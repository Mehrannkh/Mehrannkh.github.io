Once that hardens, he uses the plastic ridges to navigate a piece, lending the composition form so he can add his signature vibrant color. He playfully calls each painting 'a sight for sore eyes' and sells his art to appreciators like Warren Buffett, Elton John, and other collectors.

After bees go to work pollinating the buds, the fertilized flowers open and turn skyward transforming their pistils into soft swirling tendrils that are said to resemble an old man's whiskers. Take a good look at our image and decide if that's what comes to mind for you. As summer marches on, the plants continue their spectacular show as the fuzzy seed heads take on a pink-tinged cast resembling low-lying prairie smoke.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/emOQBEKmwuwNmN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MarleyBeach_EN-US2494809879_800x600.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Marley Beach"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Aerial view of Marley Beach</h2><p class="date">May 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We're gazing down at Marley Beach on the southwest coast of Bermuda in honor of Bermuda Day, a public holiday celebrated near the end of May. The event was first established on this British island territory in 1902, to honor Queen Victoria's birthday the year after her death, but it has evolved into a celebration of the culture. Since 2018, it's been observed on the last Friday of May. Locals celebrate the end of winter on this day with a swim or boat ride. Today's holiday also marks the date when islanders transition to a summer wardrobe at work. For the next several months, Bermuda shorts, which hit just above the knee, will be considered appropriate business attire for the island's most dapper gentlemen.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/bBltbsCLufPWLl.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzRiver_EN-US2549480300_800x600.jpg" alt="Santa Cruz River"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Santa Cruz River</h2><p class="date">May 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Squiggling east from the Andes Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, the mighty Santa Cruz River in Argentina's Patagonia region flows over some of South America's sparsest terrain. Over the centuries, some of history's most notable explorers have been drawn to the winding waterway: Ferdinand Magellan's 1520 expedition discovered its coastal delta, and Charles Darwin (on the same voyage that took him to the Galápagos Islands) studied the area's ecosystem during a grueling 1834 side trip up the river. Even now, very few settlements exist along the 240-mile course of the Santa Cruz, considered the last major free-flowing river in Patagonia.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/HvQwmkCGjKgicZ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WolfPup_EN-US2607981923_800x600.jpg" alt="Gray wolf with begging pup"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Gray wolf with begging pup</h2><p class="date">May 31, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This fuzzy pup is a young gray wolf, the largest member of the dog family (Canidae). Gray wolf pups are born between March and May, blind and deaf, but after about three weeks they're ready to leave the den and begin exploring their surroundings for the first time. It doesn't take long–around six months–before they've grown enough to join their pack on hunts.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/bBltbsCLufPWLl.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SantaCruzRiver_EN-US2549480300_200x200.jpg" alt="Santa Cruz River"></div><div class="explore-label">Santa Cruz River</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/CpqQPXdLsOTHKn.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MooseWatching_EN-US2214823502_200x200.jpg" alt="Moose snacking on water lilies in Millinocket"></div><div class="explore-label">Moose snacking on water lilies in Millinocket</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vZWOdDnXzXBvHR.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KubotaGarden_EN-US5986864816_200x200.jpg" alt="Rhododendrons and azaleas blooming around the Moon Bridge"></div><div class="explore-label">Rhododendrons and azaleas blooming around the Moon Bridge</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hbdpLBOAUmLsvg.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SiegeofCusco_EN-US6660036620_200x200.jpg" alt="Inca fortress of Sacsayhuamán near Cusco"></div><div class="explore-label">Inca fortress of Sacsayhuamán near Cusco</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IqJVPBlVHhhfgp.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChampsVEDay_EN-US3938798120_200x200.jpg" alt="People looking at the crowded Avenue des Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe on May 8"></div><div class="explore-label">People looking at the crowded Avenue des Champs-Élysées from the Arc de Triomphe on May 8</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
