Thirty years ago to the day, President George H.W. Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act. This sweeping civil rights bill prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities at work, in school, and in public spaces. The resulting law meant that much of the country's physical infrastructure, like this elegantly curving bridge, was required to accommodate people with disabilities.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/akLokEDAWyVvCu.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AerialTamul_EN-US1289516805_800x600.jpg" alt="Tamul waterfall in the state of San Luis Potosí"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Tamul waterfall in the state of San Luis Potosí</h2><p class="date">July 27, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Here in central Mexico, the Gallinas River spills into the Tampaón River gorge to create Tamul waterfall, renowned as a jewel of the country's wilderness. Both rivers offer great swimming near the falls, and boaters can float by on the Tampaón for close-up views. Both activities are best attempted between July and October, though: During wetter months, the falls converge into a thundering cataract as the Gallinas rises to form torrential rapids.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GmyPPMlgdGVlpU.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HamelinPool_EN-US1343791878_800x600.jpg" alt="Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Australia"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Australia</h2><p class="date">July 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In this shallow stretch of Shark Bay in Western Australia, a natural record of Earth's history lies just below the water's surface. Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve protects our planet's biggest collections of stromatolites—small sedimentary rock towers built up over the centuries. Each layer captures fossils of the many microorganisms that populate our oceans. Some of the stromatolites in Hamelin Pool contain fossil specimens that are 3 billion years old. When you're strolling down the boardwalk of Hamelin Pool, you're walking over an unparalleled collection of biological history. The view of the Indian Ocean's not bad either.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/JdYDDqquPozQNX.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KallurLighthouse_EN-US1393818212_800x600.jpg" alt="Kalsoy Island"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Kalsoy Island</h2><p class="date">July 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The festival known as Ólavsøka spans several days, but officially July 29 is the big day of merrymaking in the Faroe Islands.

Seventy-two miles in circumference, with an average depth of 1,000 feet, it has the sixth-largest volume of any lake in the US—only the Great Lakes are larger. For at least 6,000 years, the territory of the Washoe people centered around Lake Tahoe, but the arrival of non-native people in the 19th century led to a series of armed conflicts and eventual loss of land to farms and townships.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/alayPWXHcpaiEc.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RhodesIsland_EN-US9342527972_200x200.jpg" alt="Aerial view of blue and white parasols on the rocky coast of Rhodes"></div><div class="explore-label">Aerial view of blue and white parasols on the rocky coast of Rhodes</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/wqWljJLQyTxAkV.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EarthriseSequence_EN-US0444696608_200x200.jpg" alt="Earthrise across Mare Smythii on the moon"></div><div class="explore-label">Earthrise across Mare Smythii on the moon</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BiIJqhVfLpgiVt.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CalorisMDIS_EN-US7543211568_200x200.jpg" alt="Enhanced-color composite of the Caloris Basin"></div><div class="explore-label">Enhanced-color composite of the Caloris Basin</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/CKXxFqENdnprsX.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HamerkopHunting_EN-US1438886143_200x200.jpg" alt="Hamerkop standing on a hippo"></div><div class="explore-label">Hamerkop standing on a hippo</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XTlMNjuIBMPQJC.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Kamchatka_EN-US7415522922_200x200.jpg" alt="Tolbachik volcanic complex on the Kamchatka Peninsula"></div><div class="explore-label">Tolbachik volcanic complex on the Kamchatka Peninsula</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
