For Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee—she's been monarch for an amazing 70 years—a slew of events are planned, hitting all the notes from pomp and ceremony to picnics on the village green. Of course, the Trooping of the Colour will take center stage today as the official birthday parade, with 1,400 soldiers in full military regalia, 200 horses, and 400 military band musicians. The royal family will watch the parade and then turn their gaze to the skies as the Royal Air Force flies past. The rest of the jubilee week will include a service of thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, a live concert here at Buckingham Palace, and a special pageant featuring people from throughout Britain.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QeiJxUslHhweXK.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MoabCycling_EN-US6614069772_800x600.jpg" alt="Cycling across a natural rock arch in the desert near Moab"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Cycling across a natural rock arch in the desert near Moab</h2><p class="date">June 3, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">On this World Bicycle Day, we spy a pair of cyclists cruising across Uranium Arch, a natural rock arch in the desert near Moab, Utah.

Surfers have a special connection to the ocean and the waves it produces. A surfable wave is shaped by countless variables: The winds hundreds or thousands of miles away that produced the energy to set the swells in motion, and then the reef or point of land or underwater boulder upon which a swell will break into a perfectly shaped wave.
