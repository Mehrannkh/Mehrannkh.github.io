Originally known as Decoration Day, the tradition began in the late 1860s after the American Civil War. Communities held springtime tributes by decorating the graves of fallen Union soldiers with flowers. Over time, it expanded to commemorate all US military personnel who died in wars. Locals observe the day with ceremonies and parades across the country.<br><br>One of the most powerful symbols of this remembrance is Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The cemetery was established during the American Civil War on the grounds of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's former estate. The Union Army started burying its dead at Arlington in 1864, turning the land into a national cemetery. Currently more than 400,000 veterans and eligible family members are buried here. One of the most-visited sites in the cemetery is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, guarded 24/7 since 1937. It honors three unidentified service members with a solemn changing of the guard ceremony. Notable graves in the cemetery include former presidents William Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy. Spanning over 600 acres, it continues to hold funeral services every weekday.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202505.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./jssPYGulTdgtfy.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./bUicyDPbIkPvkt.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
