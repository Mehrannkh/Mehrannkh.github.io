Due to its improvisational nature, jazz never stays the same, fusing with other cultures and genres to create styles such as Afro-Cuban, Latin, and Indo Jazz. UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and jazz pianist Herbie Hancock created International Jazz Day to celebrate the global genre, first held in 2012 with events in New York, Paris, and New Orleans. We hope you celebrate by putting on your favorite jazz record, or if you can swing it, visit New Orleans' legendary jazz venue, Preservation Hall, seen in our photo here.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/eJNGMKwLUbQhij.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GHOAudubonDay_EN-US1034364185_200x200.jpg" alt="Great horned owl fledglings"></div><div class="explore-label">Great horned owl fledglings</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QDNNJZogbHcfeN.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedSeaStars_EN-US6473635643_200x200.jpg" alt="Mediterranean red sea stars"></div><div class="explore-label">Mediterranean red sea stars</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/DetPhORBBPpKNq.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.OcalaNF_EN-US5881034085_200x200.jpg" alt="Juniper Springs in Ocala National Forest"></div><div class="explore-label">Juniper Springs in Ocala National Forest</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/qdLbMYzULoZkuf.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RomanBridge_EN-US4101165681_200x200.jpg" alt="Roman bridge"></div><div class="explore-label">Roman bridge</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/pWdyvrzMEeAIAH.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ElephantTwins_EN-US2939253051_200x200.jpg" alt="Elephant family in Amboseli National Park"></div><div class="explore-label">Elephant family in Amboseli National Park</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
