In the following decades, several countries organized expeditions to reach and explore the Antarctic ice sheets. The southernmost continent had no indigenous population and various nations claimed ownership. But in 1959, 12 countries signed the Antarctic Treaty, banning military activities and setting Antarctica aside for scientific research.

You might recognize it from the 'Game of Thrones' series, where it featured in a scene set north of the colossal ice wall. When it's not starring on TV, it is popular with photographers thanks to its unusual shape, coastal location, and colors that shift with the seasons. And if you're lucky, and the weather conditions align, Kirkjufell offers a magnificent view of the northern lights.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/EyzAwMDKsBVvMS.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GreenlandHumpback_EN-US0330682837_800x600.jpg" alt="Humpback whale"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Humpback whale</h2><p class="date">December 28, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today is a special milestone for our furry, scaly, and feathered friends: the Endangered Species Act is turning 50. This landmark legislation, signed into law in 1973, has been helping species on the brink for half a century. Who's that in the spotlight? A humpback whale! Known for their haunting songs and acrobatic breaches, these gentle giants are a success story of the ESA. They were once on the edge of extinction, largely due to commercial whaling, but thanks to conservation efforts, their population has bounced back from around 5,000 in 1966 to an estimated 135,000 today. However, our work isn't over. Challenges persist, from habitat loss to poaching. So, what can we do? Spread the word, support conservation efforts, participate in local initiatives, and be eco-friendly.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/SNCLMiZMYGcNgX.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BlueAmsterdam_EN-US6868017848_800x600.jpg" alt="Oud-West"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Oud-West</h2><p class="date">December 29, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Welcome to Amsterdam! The capital of the Netherlands charms visitors with its historic canals, versatile architecture, and laid-back vibe. The city's history can be traced back to the 12th century when it was a fishing village on the banks of the Amstel River. Institutions like the Van Gogh Museum, the Eye Film Museum, and the National Maritime Museum offer insights into its history and arts legacy. Amsterdam's canal ring area, built at the turn of the 17th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also home to its fair share of restaurants, vintage shops, and outdoor markets in neighborhoods like Oud-West, pictured in today's image. Get ready to pedal because Amsterdam's cycling culture is ubiquitous. With approximately 320 miles of bike lanes, it's one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GTmKoBIjyrcnzJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TadamiWinter_EN-US6973402256_800x600.jpg" alt="Daiichi Tadami River Bridge"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Daiichi Tadami River Bridge</h2><p class="date">December 30, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Tadami Line is one of the most scenic railway lines in Japan.

Tonight is New Year's Eve, time to see out the old year and welcome the new. But how you celebrate depends which country you're in. If you're not in the US watching the Times Square Ball Drop, you might smash crockery in Denmark, eat 12 grapes as the clock strikes midnight in Spain, or hang onions outside your door in Greece. In Thailand, you might watch the fireworks illuminating Phra Nakhon Khiri, or 'holy city hill,' a historical park spread over three peaks overlooking the city of Phetchaburi.
