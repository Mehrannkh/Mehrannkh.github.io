But it is. This small fishing village of about 300 residents is known for its steep mountains, calm fjords, and bright red rorbuer—traditional fishermen's cabins—that dot the shoreline. Despite its size, Reine draws thousands of visitors each year.<br><br>For most of its history, Reine has been a working village. It served as a trading post in the 1700s, and fishing has always been the backbone of daily life. Even during World War II, when parts of the village were burned by German forces, locals rebuilt and carried on. Today, people come for all kinds of experiences. Some climb Reinebringen for its sweeping views; others wander the shoreline or try a plate of fish that was probably caught that morning. Staying in a restored cabin offers a glimpse of what life here looked like before tourism arrived. What makes Reine memorable isn't a list of 'must-do' activities; it's the history, tradition, and sense of community that settle in the moment you arrive.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202601.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./geaArTXgwhsIzm.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./syiDeGjpcufMkG.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
