The event was established in 2012 to encourage acts of generosity during the holidays, when consumerism seems to be the focus for so many. Giving Tuesday was started by a small nonprofit on the East Coast and with the help of social media campaigns, it's grown into a global movement, perhaps observed even here at the Skomer Island nature reserve in Wales. In 2018, Giving Tuesday participants in the US raised $400 million. Of course, you don't have to give money to participate. Organizers urge folks to volunteer or take a cue from our homepage puffins, and simply show kindness to one another. Now that's something we can all get behind (seabirds included).</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/201912.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./oOTbGbLJhtIfvM.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./HBuFzbVqQpoMkb.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
