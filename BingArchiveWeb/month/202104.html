Although none are as skilled at self-concealment as this specimen from the Loxodonta genus of African elephants—namely the species laprofolis, better known as the common chia elephant. While it's the well-known habit of other pachyderms to paint their toenails red and hide in cherry trees, the chia elephant's defense is even more unique: After a nice roll in the mud, the elephant charges through patches of seeding chia plants, picking up thousands of seeds that stick on its grooved hide. In under a week—just add water!—the seeds sprout and develop into dense, leafy growths that allow the elephant to conveniently camouflage itself as it wanders the savanna. The curious creature has even been reported to disguise itself as a houseplant, duping homeowners into hosting a literal elephant in the room.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GVmsaPaQREaShi.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BrazilSandDunes_EN-US8030598740_800x600.jpg" alt="Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in the state of Maranhão"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Lençóis Maranhenses National Park in the state of Maranhão</h2><p class="date">April 2, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">From the air, the mesmerizing tapestry of sandy dunes and lagoons you see here gives Lençóis Maranhenses National Park an otherworldly, desert-like appearance.

The 43 events included a marathon, tennis, cycling, fencing, shooting, Greco-Roman wrestling, and swimming. And while some things haven't changed over the years, some were pretty different back then.

Peak bloom usually arrives between early and mid-April.

Dewy mornings, grazing farm animals, hand-built dry stone walls, and…cheese? Well, if you're a fan of the beloved British claymation series 'Wallace & Gromit,' you may have first heard of this area of the Dales, Wensleydale, because of its local cheese. In fact, the animated duo's notorious affinity for the local curd—which Wallace likes because producers thought saying it makes his face look 'nice and toothy'—became so widespread that it helped the Wensleydale cheesemakers stave off bankruptcy.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RaerNuHwZpAhDh.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.KusamaPumpkin_EN-US1211132220_800x600.jpg" alt="Yayoi Kusama's 'Pumpkin' artwork on Naoshima Island"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Yayoi Kusama's 'Pumpkin' artwork on Naoshima Island</h2><p class="date">April 27, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Happy International Design Day! It's been said the best designs are the ones you never notice, but this giant yellow polka-dotted pumpkin on Japan's Naoshima Island is kind of hard to miss. The sculpture is the work of Yayoi Kusama, an avant-garde artist active since the 1950s and known for crafting outlandish, repeating patterns in bright colors. Polka dots and pumpkins are her most famous motifs, showing up not only on her sculptures but in her paintings, performance pieces, and films.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/arbgNmQTvdpHLJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GannetsSaltee_EN-US1285648780_800x600.jpg" alt="Northern gannets on Great Saltee Island"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Northern gannets on Great Saltee Island</h2><p class="date">April 28, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">From North America to Western Europe, northern gannets live all along the North Atlantic coasts. These large birds spend most of their lives at sea, following schools of sardines, herring, and other small fish that they feed on. During breeding and hatching season, northern gannets often return to the same colony locations year after year, where thousands of birds may gather to nest and rear their young. This group is busily collecting nesting material on Great Saltee Island, the larger of the two Saltee Islands, about 3 miles off the coast of southern Ireland. Both Great and Little Saltee are largely unoccupied, well, unless you count all the birds.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aBsuKZLFCyCrhQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Mockhorn_EN-US1360987065_800x600.jpg" alt="Aerial view of tidal channels in marshland of the Mockhorn Island State Wildlife Management Area"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Aerial view of tidal channels in marshland of the Mockhorn Island State Wildlife Management Area</h2><p class="date">April 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">From the air, this tract of Mockhorn Island on the Atlantic coast of Virginia's Eastern Shore could pass for gentle farmland. But what you're really looking at is rugged tidal marshland, visible when the tide is out—the rest of the time, much of this area is underwater. Mockhorn is itself part of Virginia's coastal island chain called the Barrier Islands, which run down the east coast of the state from the Maryland-Delaware border for about 70 miles, stretching to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. The green vegetation you see is grass, although not the kind you'll find in a suburban lawn. Instead, it's saltmarsh cordgrass, a type of perennial deciduous species that grows in wetlands and salt marshes like this one.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vnMCpCsLKVXWqa.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpiritHarlem_EN-US1474494856_800x600.jpg" alt="'The Spirit of Harlem' mural by Louis Delsarte in Harlem"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">'The Spirit of Harlem' mural by Louis Delsarte in Harlem</h2><p class="date">April 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">On International Jazz Day, we're looking at 'The Spirit of Harlem,' a glass mosaic mural by artist Louis Delsarte. Located near the legendary Apollo Theater in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, it depicts, among others, jazz greats Cab Calloway and Count Basie. Originally commissioned in 2005, the mural was covered up in 2017 when a new store moved into its location. After a petition and protests, the retailer worked with Delsarte to restore the mural and add a new plaque dedicating it to the Harlem community. Delsarte, whose other works include a 125-foot-long mural at the Martin Luther King Jr. Natatorium in Atlanta, died in May 2020.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/rqIPhOGgmTjXnm.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TetraoTetrix_EN-US8933698445_200x200.jpg" alt="Black grouse male calling at a lek site in Kuusamo"></div><div class="explore-label">Black grouse male calling at a lek site in Kuusamo</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MRmHyFSLweqqbE.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EggTree_EN-US8284116541_200x200.jpg" alt="An Ostereierbaum (Easter egg tree) in Saalfeld"></div><div class="explore-label">An Ostereierbaum (Easter egg tree) in Saalfeld</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/raEfQsOtcYosDL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.YurisNight_EN-US6858652982_200x200.jpg" alt="Earth viewed from the International Space Station"></div><div class="explore-label">Earth viewed from the International Space Station</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/RtitcBgCcwYLmL.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MontalbanoElicona_EN-US7629651237_200x200.jpg" alt="Montalbano Elicona"></div><div class="explore-label">Montalbano Elicona</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/arbgNmQTvdpHLJ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GannetsSaltee_EN-US1285648780_200x200.jpg" alt="Northern gannets on Great Saltee Island"></div><div class="explore-label">Northern gannets on Great Saltee Island</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
