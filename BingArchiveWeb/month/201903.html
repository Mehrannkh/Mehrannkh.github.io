Beginning more than 5,000 years ago, this area was mined for gold, silver, and other treasures. And archeological evidence suggests that about 3,000 years ago this may have been the site of King Solomon’s legendary mines. Scientists believe that pollution from the mines contributed to the extreme ecological conditions we see in the Rio Tinto today.But if you think nothing could live in such a desolate place, you'd be wrong. The Rio Tinto is home to unusual microorganisms that feed on its toxic mix and may also contribute to the river’s otherworldly environment. NASA even dispatched a team here to study the surface below the Rio Tinto because it closely resembles the subsurface on that other 'red' destination—Mars.

Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky—but has become the 'butt' of many middle-school jokes. (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) The planet, along with Neptune, is considered an ‘ice giant,’ with most of its mass made up of a hot, dense fluid of ‘icy’ materials including water, methane, and ammonia all hovering above its small, rocky core. Uranus’ atmosphere is made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with some methane. It’s the methane that makes the planet appear blue—the chemical compound absorbs red light from the sun and reflects the blue light back into space. Not only is it cold out there, but it’s also a little lonely. Uranus can’t support life as we know it, and the unmanned space probe Voyager 2, which took this photo, is so far the only spacecraft to fly by.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/lWVOSjEPqOtbfg.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AgriculturalPi_EN-US0259030447_800x600.jpg" alt="Circular agricultural fields in Morgan County"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Circular agricultural fields in Morgan County</h2><p class="date">March 14, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">It’s Pi Day, the day we celebrate the mathematical constant π.

But what is an equinox, exactly? The answer lies in the tilt of the Earth’s axis. When it’s winter in the Northern Hemisphere, those of us above the equator are tilted away from the sun, giving us shorter days and longer nights. In summer, we’re tilted toward the sun, so we can enjoy longer days and shorter nights. But the equinox is right in between. It's the moment during Earth's annual revolution around the sun when its axis is neither tilting away nor tilting toward the sun, giving everyone on the planet an equal split of day and night. This phenomenon happens twice a year—in March and again in September. For folks in the Northern Hemisphere, today signals a shift toward the long days of summer. But in the Southern Hemisphere, everything's flipped.

This year’s theme for International Day of Forests is ‘forests and education’; it’s an effort to get us all thinking about the more abstract benefits of healthy forests.
