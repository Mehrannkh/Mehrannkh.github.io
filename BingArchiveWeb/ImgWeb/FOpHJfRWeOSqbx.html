Well, for the real nerds among you, it's because July 17, 2002, is the date Apple first rolled out its iCal app (the icon for which inspired the iPhone calendar emoji). But if your reaction to that trivia is 😴, just think of it as a good reminder—like the smiling interior of the hot air balloon in today's photo—that today is World Emoji Day. 🥳<br><br>If you still type :-D instead of 😀 to express joy, you're certainly old school, but maybe less so than your (grand)kids think. Even Harvey Ball—who designed the iconic yellow-pated smiley (a prototype for 🙂) way back in 1963—was late to the emoji party: A clay pot discovered in Turkey bears the oldest known cartoon of a smiling face, which dates back about 4,000 years. These days, emoji are a virtual second language for the whole 🌎. They’re organized under the Unicode Standard for text encoding, which ensures that characters from A to Z to Æ to ‽ to 💯 display similarly across communication platforms and languages. The underlying code is overseen by the Unicode Consortium, a humble Bay Area nonprofit despite its vaguely dystopian name. Actually, it's quite the democracy: Anyone anywhere can make a case for a new emoji, so if you've got an idea for a 🔥 one, get over to unicode.org and fill out a proposal. 😎</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202007.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./LOwRkYqprxgcId.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./IZVzKbgQtweYzv.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
