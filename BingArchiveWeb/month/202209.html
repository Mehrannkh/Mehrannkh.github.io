Things came to a head after the National Industrial Recovery Act became law in 1933, leading to the formation of the Textile Industry Committee meant to represent the interests of business owners, consumers, and workers—but this only led to shortened workweeks, effectively reducing wages by 25%.

They include what is perhaps the most famous geyser of them all: Old Faithful. But the Upper Basin contains many other geysers as well, including the tallest predictable geyser (Grand Geyser) and the most voluminous geyser (Giant Geyser). Yellowstone contains about 500 geysers, roughly two-thirds the number in the entire world.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/QsPRFlnllQYAXI.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.FosterCoveredBridge_EN-US7763700078_800x600.jpg" alt="A.

Foster Bridge in Cabot</h2><p class="date">September 28, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">At one point in history, the United States had upwards of 14,000 wooden covered bridges. Most of them were built between 1825 and 1875 to cross a stream or river and were intended to withstand the elements. An uncovered wooden bridge may have a life span of only about 20 years while a covered bridge could stand for more than 100. Even still, they don't fare well without upkeep and restoration costs can be high. That's why iron replaced wood as the preferred bridge-building material in the mid-1800s. These days, fewer than 900 of the original wooden covered bridges are believed to still be standing. The A. M. Foster Bridge, seen in today's photo, can be found in Cabot, Vermont.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/FgBTrcuhjvJzDc.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.InfiniD_EN-US7855471603_800x600.jpg" alt="Infini-D"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Infini-D</h2><p class="date">September 29, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Clothes used to be animal hides and fur. Art used to be stick figures painted on cave walls. Times have changed. Now fashion is a major industry and art can be a lucrative field, too. Today we're celebrating 'wearable art,' which blurs genres and has passionate devotees. Curious? Well, check out the World of WearableArt (WOW), which is WOW-ing (sorry) fashion and art fans with its awards show in New Zealand right now. The competition runs till October 16 and features work by global designers, artists, and costumers—it's New Zealand's largest theatrical production. The competition is just part of the event, though—there are dancers, musicians, and aerialists, too.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/OwpLOQkgcXkIrQ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EubalaenaAustralis_EN-US7949014397_800x600.jpg" alt="Southern right whale diving in the Golfo Nuevo near the Valdes Peninsula"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Southern right whale diving in the Golfo Nuevo near the Valdes Peninsula</h2><p class="date">September 30, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The end of September in the Southern Hemisphere means warming weather and the nearing of summer. For southern right whales like this one off the coast of Argentina, it's time to migrate southward toward Antarctica and rich feeding grounds. Southern right whales are a subspecies of right whale that inhabit the oceans below the equator. They feed on krill at the surface of the water, holding their mouths open as they swim through clouds of the tiny crustaceans.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/fKHhsvHpVeqhnZ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CircumnavigationAnni_EN-US9635067459_200x200.jpg" alt="View of the city from the Setas de Sevilla (Metropol Parasol) in Seville"></div><div class="explore-label">View of the city from the Setas de Sevilla (Metropol Parasol) in Seville</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/OwpLOQkgcXkIrQ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EubalaenaAustralis_EN-US7949014397_200x200.jpg" alt="Southern right whale diving in the Golfo Nuevo near the Valdes Peninsula"></div><div class="explore-label">Southern right whale diving in the Golfo Nuevo near the Valdes Peninsula</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/KcdDduPcFAPBeW.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MuseudoAmanha_EN-US9576177041_200x200.jpg" alt="Museu do Amanhã (Museum of Tomorrow) in Rio de Janeiro"></div><div class="explore-label">Museu do Amanhã (Museum of Tomorrow) in Rio de Janeiro</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/zLciNbUtzHFeDz.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GoldenJellyfish_EN-US6743816471_200x200.jpg" alt="Golden jellyfish in Jellyfish Lake on the island of Eil Malk"></div><div class="explore-label">Golden jellyfish in Jellyfish Lake on the island of Eil Malk</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/TwQiwSKNoeUMic.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmazonMangroves_EN-US7068770726_200x200.jpg" alt="Aerial view of the Amazon River in Brazil"></div><div class="explore-label">Aerial view of the Amazon River in Brazil</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
