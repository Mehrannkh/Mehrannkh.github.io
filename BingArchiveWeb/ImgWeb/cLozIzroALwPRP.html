Today, we're dipping our toes in the pristine waters of Lake Zürich in Switzerland's largest city, which has developed its own urban lido culture. Dotted across Zürich, you'll find lots of lidos (public open-air swimming pools or bathing beaches) that make the most of the city's lakes. This time of year, it's common to see bankers and other workers change from business suits into bathing suits as they enjoy a quick swim during their lunch break.<br><br>The lakeside lido in our image is called Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen. There's no sand here, but it does feature a circular boardwalk built over the water that surrounds a shallow pool. Nearby, there's a 200-foot water slide spilling into the lake, diving platforms, and a sprawling lawn for sunbathing and activities including yoga, volleyball, and table tennis. And of course, as we're in Switzerland, you're never far from the mountains—the snow-clad Alps are visible from here on a clear day. Swiss bliss.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202108.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./KWGIujXmscfNBP.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./cWnkbGKVNkzcON.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
