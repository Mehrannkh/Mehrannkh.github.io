Among its lesser-known treasures lies the Clark Range—the rugged, high-elevation spine seen in today's image.

Their golden glow depends on many factors—tree health, local weather shifts, soil moisture, and where they grow in terms of elevation and latitude. Healthy aspens are the true stars of the season: strong, thriving groves burst with brighter colors and hold onto their leaves longer, while stressed or weakened trees often fade quickly, offering only a glimpse of their usual brilliance.

On its northern slopes lies Fanal Forest, where veils of mist drift through centuries-old til trees. These are part of the Laurissilva of Madeira—an outstanding relict of a once widespread laurel forest type. Laurissilva is the largest surviving area of its kind, with about 90% considered primary forest. Home to a unique array of plants and animals, including endemic species such as the Madeiran long-toed pigeon, it remains a living museum of natural history.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/KVqLduCMmTWrXr.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PushkarFair_EN-US4430814252_800x600.jpg" alt="Camels at Jaisalmer"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Camels at Jaisalmer</h2><p class="date">October 30, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Every fall, the desert town of Pushkar in Rajasthan, India, comes alive with one of the most colorful gatherings—the Pushkar Camel Fair.

The fortress was built in the 14th century and has withstood wars, monarchs, and shifting empires. But here, legends speak louder than history. Perched between the regions of Transylvania—renowned for its chilling tales—and Wallachia, once ruled by Vlad III Dracula, the castle evokes a haunting legacy.
