Held annually on the Tuesday after the US Thanksgiving, the global movement serves to encourage acts of generosity during the holidays, when consumerism seems to be the focus for so many. Giving Tuesday was founded in 2012 by New York's 92nd Street Y in partnership with the United Nations Foundation. Originally observed only in the US, it's grown into a worldwide celebration of generosity promoted by a newly independent organization.

Not quite, but these clock-like rotors did help alter the course of history. The action took place during World War II at England's Bletchley Park, a country estate that served as a top-secret facility. An assembled team, including the pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, developed this device, known as a Bombe machine. It was instrumental in cracking the Germans' 'uncrackable' Enigma code, which was used for encrypting secret messages in German war operations. The Enigma code was itself generated by a rotor-driven machine that re-scrambled the code each day—so the Bombe mirrored those mechanics to keep up with the changing encryption.

The ornate, woody pine cones shown here are females, and they're designed to create and protect seeds. Male cones, which are usually smaller, produce pollen.

This image is just a glimpse of what awaits you in the park. More than 8.5 million LED lightbulbs illuminate pathways, trees, and the park's famous 'Tunnel of Lights.' Can't make it for the holidays? No worries. While many of Japan's light displays end after the new year, this one lasts from mid-October through early May. And if not this year (hello pandemic), maybe next?</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hfsglosgKDZpSv.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CanadaLynx_EN-US0499765045_800x600.jpg" alt="Canada lynx in Montana"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Canada lynx in Montana</h2><p class="date">December 28, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">If you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of this wily wildcat species in many places across Alaska and far-northern Canada. But here in Montana, a Canada lynx encounter like this is rare. While lynxes are known to live in cold climates from Washington state to Maine, they've been listed for two decades as threatened across the lower 48 states.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BPHiDKwWlBftkh.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LucerneHoliday_EN-US0563120968_800x600.jpg" alt="Old Town of Lucerne"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Old Town of Lucerne</h2><p class="date">December 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">On the shores of Lake Lucerne and bestride the River Reuss, you'll find the medieval Swiss city that shares the lake's name. Emerging from a Benedictine monastery founded here in 750, Lucerne is today the largest town in central Switzerland. The central of three ancient, covered wooden pedestrian bridges of Lucerne's Old Town has a unique feature. The interior of the Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge) is painted with religious scenes and allegories to edify those walking across it to the nearby St. Peter's Chapel.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GUyOkzjmeZRVAD.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WinterBryce_EN-US0613213485_800x600.jpg" alt="Winter in Bryce Canyon National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Winter in Bryce Canyon National Park</h2><p class="date">December 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">When considering the dramatically eroded canyons of southwestern Utah, snow may not be the first thing that comes to mind. But far-flung Bryce Canyon National Park gets plenty of the white stuff, owing to its elevation of 8,000-plus feet at the massive amphitheater's rim. The cold not only provides scenic snowy views and great cross-country skiing, it's responsible for the striking red-rock pinnacles—known as hoodoos—that make the park so unique.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/aOrNNZLNRpBkjJ.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ZaragozaSpain_EN-US0650637184_800x600.jpg" alt="Fireworks during a New Year's Eve celebration in Zaragoza"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Fireworks during a New Year's Eve celebration in Zaragoza</h2><p class="date">December 31, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">New Year's Eve celebrations around the world will look a lot different this year, but as we ring in 2021 (and bid good riddance to 2020?) we can still enjoy this view of fireworks from a previous year in Spain. The cathedral in the background is the Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar, which was constructed over centuries beginning in 1681, though several churches had been built on the site prior to that. On the left is the Puente de Piedra Bridge, which spans the Ebro River. It's also known as the Bridge of Lions because statues of lions (symbols of the city) stand at each end of the bridge. Zaragoza is famous for its landmarks and architecture, as well as for local cuisine, and seasonal festivals—which we can only hope return soon.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/BPHiDKwWlBftkh.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LucerneHoliday_EN-US0563120968_200x200.jpg" alt="Old Town of Lucerne"></div><div class="explore-label">Old Town of Lucerne</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/OpxuBXUITCWfJw.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BractCloseup_EN-US2083623903_200x200.jpg" alt="Poinsettia leaf close-up"></div><div class="explore-label">Poinsettia leaf close-up</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GtqzjNsVSsAWNk.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HolidayNubble_EN-US0252350688_200x200.jpg" alt="Holiday lights on Cape Neddick Light in York"></div><div class="explore-label">Holiday lights on Cape Neddick Light in York</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/VqzNctcFlLuOsn.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WildReindeer_EN-US0339848363_200x200.jpg" alt="Northern lights and wild reindeer on the tundra in Norway"></div><div class="explore-label">Northern lights and wild reindeer on the tundra in Norway</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/clgaZKGEagXnzT.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WWIIPHDedication_EN-US1829070269_200x200.jpg" alt="View of the Washington Monument and the National World War II Memorial with its Pearl Harbor Dedication"></div><div class="explore-label">View of the Washington Monument and the National World War II Memorial with its Pearl Harbor Dedication</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
