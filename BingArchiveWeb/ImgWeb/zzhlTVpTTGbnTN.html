It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase, and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney.<br><br>Today, the forest where her house once stood spans over 500 acres and offers scenic hiking trails through woodlands, hemlock groves, and around peaceful brooks, a picturesque setting for outdoor enthusiasts. Managed by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, this area was named in honor of Madame Sherri, and it also includes trails that lead to the ruins of her former estate. So, while the house was originally separate from the forest, the two are now intricately entwined.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202410.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./gXxLEvsogssFTR.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./MEIvfJWeOvywFz.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
