Woodson launched Negro History Week. The week grew, spread through schools and communities, and by 1976 it officially expanded into a month.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hiutQKzFRnhrTS.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://bing.com/th?id=OHR.AlpineMarmots_EN-US0200342638_800x600.jpg" alt="Alpine marmots"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Alpine marmots</h2><p class="date">February 2, 2026</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Every February 2, the world turns its eyes to a furry little forecaster with a penchant for popping out of holes: the groundhog.

Lake Tahoe, straddling the border between California and Nevada, fits that bill perfectly. Formed during the Ice Age, the lake was shaped by faulting and glacial carving that created its deep basin. It is now one of the deepest freshwater lakes in the United States. For generations, the Washoe people lived around these clear waters, fishing and gathering seasonally. Centuries later, miners arrived, steamboats crossed the water, and Tahoe shifted from a resource hub to a year-round retreat.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ZjJIQbheIPvPqA.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://bing.com/th?id=OHR.ParksGlass_EN-US0280057691_800x600.jpg" alt="Rosa Parks in stained glass window"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Rosa Parks in stained glass window</h2><p class="date">February 4, 2026</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Picture this: it's 1955, a winter evening in Montgomery, Alabama.

You can't help but pause and look closer, right? Centuries back, families began carving these limestone pans, shaping hundreds of basins that trap seawater with each wave. Once the water settles in, the sun's heat does the rest, slowly evaporating it into natural Mediterranean salt. Gozo became a salt-making hub because its limestone coast is easy to shape, and its warm, dry summers keep the crystallization process steady. The first crystals form around May, marking the beginning of the harvesting season. Workers rake the salt by hand, sweep it with brooms and brushes, gather it into small piles to dry for another day, then bag it and store it in the caves.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/NPHOlQmPawwcaV.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://bing.com/th?id=OHR.GiauPass_EN-US1580552183_800x600.jpg" alt="Ra Gusela peak at Giau Pass"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Ra Gusela peak at Giau Pass</h2><p class="date">February 6, 2026</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The 2026 Winter Olympics begin today, and few settings capture their spirit better than the Dolomites.
