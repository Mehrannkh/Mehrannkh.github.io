Lei Day was first celebrated in 1927 and made an official holiday in 1929. It also happens to fall on the first day of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, which honors Americans of Asian, Melanesian, Micronesian, and Polynesian heritage.

According to British folklore, a blooming bluebell carpet on the woodland floor is a mystical place where fairies live. The legends hold that fairies hang their spells on the flowers to dry, and disturbing them would unleash the magic. In earlier times, children were warned that picking bluebells would cause them to be spirited away. Even adults could fall victim to the flower, being doomed to wander the woods and never escape. And heaven forbid you ever happen to hear the fairies ring the bluebells for their gatherings—it means your death is imminent, a belief that inspired another name for bluebells: 'dead men's bells.'</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/WUZCzfHPNZcUKa.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SwedishAntenna_EN-US4697496933_800x600.jpg" alt="Swedish telescope at La Silla ESO Observatory"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Swedish telescope at La Silla ESO Observatory</h2><p class="date">May 7, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In one of the darkest places on Earth there's a cluster of telescopes that examine the heavens each night, sending detailed information about the celestial bodies they observe to astronomers across the planet.

Here in Cappadocia, in south-central Turkey, they were formed when a thick layer of volcanic ash solidified over millions of years into soft, porous rock called tuff that was overlaid by hard basalt. Cracks in the basalt allowed wind and rain to gradually wash away the softer bottom layer, leaving the hard basalt to cap tall columns of the tuff.
