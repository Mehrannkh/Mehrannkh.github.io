These gourds have rolled their way into pies, porches, lattes, and parades, but today they get the spotlight: It's National Pumpkin Day. Some places go all out to show their affection—Morton, Illinois, calls itself the 'Pumpkin Capital of the World,' thanks to its high production and ties to canned pumpkin. New Hampshire follows closely, with pumpkin as its official state fruit.<br><br>Ever wondered why we carve this squash? The tradition comes from an old Irish story about a man called Stingy Jack. According to legend, Jack tricked the Devil multiple times and was denied entry to both heaven and hell, leaving him to wander the Earth with only a carved-out turnip and a glowing coal to light his way. Immigrants brought the tale to America, where pumpkins—larger and easier to carve than turnips—became the canvas for glowing jack-o'-lanterns. The Connecticut field pumpkin is the go-to variety thanks to its size, smooth skin, and bright orange hue. The color of pumpkins comes from beta-carotene, but not all are orange—some grow white, green, or even blue. Their utility doesn't end there—pumpkins have stood guard as scarecrows, been launched in pumpkin-chucking contests, and even hollowed out for boat races. So, have you sharpened your carving tools?</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202510.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./GwnMPqqdosBuZt.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./XGEYJVZLbqQTWV.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
