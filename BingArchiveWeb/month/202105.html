It's no joke that laughter has a clinically proven positive effect on your well-being. And experts (yes, there are experts) agree that laughing lowers blood pressure, releases endorphins, works your abs, reduces stress hormones, and even boosts T cells that fight infection.

Birds can relate. Take for example the uninvited speckly-white visitor to this robin's nest: That smaller egg belongs to a baby cowbird whose mother sneakily laid it among the blue robin eggs when no one was looking. Once the baby birds all hatch, the cowbird will grow much faster and larger than its robin 'siblings,' soon becoming an only chick by muscling them right out of the nest. And if mama robin ejects the cowbird egg before it hatches, the cowbird mom may take notice and chuck the remaining robin eggs from the nest out of spite.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MpAwhnIKOSWoVo.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedAlley_EN-US8215991251_800x600.jpg" alt="Alley and bamboo grove in Wuhou Temple"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Alley and bamboo grove in Wuhou Temple</h2><p class="date">May 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">When it comes to tourist destinations, the Wuhou Temple in the city of Chengdu, China, must be among the world's oldest. It's been attracting visitors for nearly 1,800 years and remains one of the most popular attractions in all of China. Located in Sichuan province, this temple complex was constructed to honor two principal members of the Shu Han state (221-263) of China's early Three Kingdoms period. And although the founder of Shu Han, Liu Bei, is honored with his own temple and shrine here, the real headliner is one of China's most important historical figures, Zhuge Liang, who is remembered as a great wit, scholar, astronomer, statesman, and military strategist. In fact, the name Wuhou itself derives from the Chinese title 'Marquis of Wu,' which was an honorary title given to Zhuge Liang.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/fiLfmNXHSwVHMG.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeaDog_EN-US8346901369_800x600.jpg" alt="California sea lion in a forest of giant kelp near the Channel Islands of California"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">California sea lion in a forest of giant kelp near the Channel Islands of California</h2><p class="date">May 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This California sea lion is peeking out from a kelp forest near the Channel Islands of California. Although this species is named for the Golden State, the California sea lion's range stretches all along the western coast of North America, from central Mexico up to Southeast Alaska. They tend to live in shallow coastal areas, dining on squid, anchovies, mackerel, and more. Highly social and intelligent, California sea lions often congregate in large—and loud—colonies on beaches and rocky shores to breed and have their pups.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/kAZOBwouhJTziz.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WomensMemorial_EN-US8561851319_800x600.jpg" alt="Military Women's Memorial"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Military Women's Memorial</h2><p class="date">May 31, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">For this Memorial Day, we're paying our respects at the Military Women's Memorial, at the gateway to Arlington National Cemetery, just across the Potomac River from Washington, DC. Since the American Revolution, more than 3 million women have served the nation in a military capacity, and this memorial is dedicated to them, honoring their courage, patriotism, and leadership. Opened in 1997, it's the only major national memorial to honor all the women who have defended the United States in, or with, the armed services. And it's more than just a memorial. It's also an education center, with thousands of photographs, documents, textiles, artifacts, and other materials representing all eras and services of American women's military history.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/ZFGNeKhgAtuCVh.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AarhusInfinite_EN-US7607613784_200x200.jpg" alt="The Infinite Bridge in Aarhus"></div><div class="explore-label">The Infinite Bridge in Aarhus</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/GWhgWWukGWnYCR.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AltaFloresta_EN-US4736416258_200x200.jpg" alt="Amazon rainforest with morning fog near Alta Floresta"></div><div class="explore-label">Amazon rainforest with morning fog near Alta Floresta</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/LiVzwLwjkVPIAp.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TeacherHeart_EN-US1874465116_200x200.jpg" alt="Poster for Teacher Appreciation Week by 12-year-old Caroline Holt"></div><div class="explore-label">Poster for Teacher Appreciation Week by 12-year-old Caroline Holt</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/CQhWIiFbSLdlul.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Cholula_EN-US2015612893_200x200.jpg" alt="The Great Pyramid of Cholula"></div><div class="explore-label">The Great Pyramid of Cholula</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ElujMVlgRlmJXX.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MaineWetland_EN-US3940841989_200x200.jpg" alt="Norcross Brook and wetlands near Moosehead Lake in Piscataquis County"></div><div class="explore-label">Norcross Brook and wetlands near Moosehead Lake in Piscataquis County</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
