Its origins are rooted in late 1800s efforts to recognize the contributions the country's workers, and labor activists ultimately helped establish the 40-hour work week and weekends. President Grover Cleveland made the US holiday official in 1894.

To reverse this trend, Zahniser wrote most of what became the Wilderness Act.

There used to be as many as 300,000 sea otters in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for their dense fur for almost two centuries. By 1911, it is thought that only around 2,000 sea otters were left.
