While many were built in the 19th century, few have survived to the present day, and the ones that have are often preserved for their historical and visual significance.<br><br>The West Cornwall bridge in Cornwall, Connecticut, is a historic wooden lattice truss bridge that spans the Housatonic River. Constructed in 1864 using the central pier from an earlier bridge, it's one of only three remaining roofed bridges in Connecticut. Modified about 50 years ago, it was recognized as a national historic building in 1975 and still supports traffic today. The bridge has appeared in films and postcards, embodying the classic image of a New England village.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202409.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./QmmENafaYjJDBE.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./rYSzldZJNPGRUS.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
