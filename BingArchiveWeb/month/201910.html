Most are small, with a pointed nose, large eyes, and a tail. They mainly live in trees and can be highly social, like the ring-tailed lemurs on our homepage, or live a solo existence like the elusive aye-aye. Lemurs have opposable thumbs and five fingers with fingernails on each hand, characteristics that help secure their spot as members of the primate order of mammals. About 65 million years ago, scientists believe, lemurs drifted on rafts of vegetation from the African continent to the shores of Madagascar. Safe from competition and most predators, lemurs evolved into many highly specialized varieties and now can be found in almost all habitats on the island.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/rFJruPTcvdztje.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.UnendingAttraction_EN-US6298041317_800x600.jpg" alt="Klaus Littmann's 'FOR FOREST: The Unending Attraction of Nature' in Wörthersee Stadion"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Klaus Littmann's 'FOR FOREST: The Unending Attraction of Nature' in Wörthersee Stadion</h2><p class="date">October 26, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">When artist Klaus Littmann covered the pitch of this Austrian soccer stadium with 300 trees, he not only created the country's largest public art installation—he brought to life a vision of a dystopian future. The installation here at Wörthersee Stadion (Stadium) in the city of Klagenfurt made headlines around the world when it was unveiled on September 8, 2019. Titled 'FOR FOREST: The Unending Attraction of Nature,' it's inspired by a nearly identical pencil drawing created in 1970 by Max Peintner, an artist known in the European environmental movement. Littmann first saw the drawing 30 years ago and in the decades since, he held onto his dream of turning it into a reality. Through his work, he hopes to spark conversation about climate change, perception, and the relationship between nature and people. If you'd like to see it in person, you'll have to hurry. It closes tomorrow, October 27, at 10 PM.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/bjCkPhWMGaWXwe.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaryuRiverDiyas_EN-US6395385901_800x600.jpg" alt="Devotees light oil lamps on the banks of the Sarayu River in Ayodhya"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Devotees light oil lamps on the banks of the Sarayu River in Ayodhya</h2><p class="date">October 27, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">In observance of the Hindu holiday called Diwali, people gathered on the banks of the Sarayu River in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya in autumn of 2018 to light candles and oil lamps called 'diyas.' Attendees that night set a Guinness World Record by keeping 300,000 diyas lit for five minutes. The lights are symbolic of the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness—central themes of Diwali. Ayodhya is a significant location in the Hindu faith, long thought to be the birthplace of Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, who represents virtue. And as Diwali, a four- or five-day celebration reaches its peak today (the third day), the Hindus of Ayodhya will be back to light up the riverbank.

It's the Fort Rock Valley Historical Homestead Museum in central Oregon, a collection of abandoned homestead-era buildings from the area. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, people acquired federal lands around here for farms and ranches via the Homestead Acts. But most left within a few years due to the hot, dry summers and extremely cold winters. Today, the buildings are assembled as a ghost town and contain items from that period, including furniture, dishes, and tools. There's also a nearby cemetery which, according to local lore, is haunted by the ghost of rancher and author Reub Long riding his horse.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/MfRQGOJUdChdUw.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.EidolonHelvum_EN-US6513918726_800x600.jpg" alt="Straw-colored fruit bats in Kasanka National Park"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Straw-colored fruit bats in Kasanka National Park</h2><p class="date">October 29, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">As if right on cue for Halloween, this is the time of year when millions of straw-colored fruit bats begin to descend on Zambia's Kasanka National Park. They come in such vast numbers that it's thought to be one of the largest concentrations of mammals in the world. From the end of October to mid-December, these large fruit-eating bats pack into a small area in the forest to roost. But when the sun begins to set, they start to swarm, darkening the skies as they head out to gorge on fruit in the Mushitu swamp forest. Experts believe their migration starts about 2,000 miles north, in Congo.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cqKDrtGoSCPZTb.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CharlesNight_EN-US6584049116_800x600.jpg" alt="Charles Bridge over the Vltava River in Prague"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Charles Bridge over the Vltava River in Prague</h2><p class="date">October 30, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Superstition abounds on Prague's Charles Bridge, dating back to its construction in 1357. Builders laid the original bridge stone on July 9 at exactly 5:31 AM, the year, date, and time represented by a precise set of numbers that formed a palindrome: 135797531 (or 1357 9, 7 5:31). The sequence, which reads the same backward and forward, is carved onto the stones of the Old Town Bridge Tower at the east end of the bridge and was believed to bring a kind of magical strength to the structure. But the superstition didn't stop there. The bridge was also constructed in perfect alignment with the tomb of Saint Vitus and the setting sun on the equinox. A more recent superstition involves the statue of the revered Saint John of Nepomuk that stands on the bridge—according to folklore, rubbing the plaque at the base of the statue will grant you a wish.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ccQmhcclumuYcI.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.VampireCastle_EN-US6679168218_800x600.jpg" alt="Corvin Castle"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Corvin Castle</h2><p class="date">October 31, 2019</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Happy Halloween, boos and ghouls!
