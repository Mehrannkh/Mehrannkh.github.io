Their ability to turn their heads up to 270 degrees—combined with silent flight and exceptional night vision—showcases their remarkable adaptations. With over 200 species found across the globe, these birds contribute to ecological balance and are deeply woven into cultural traditions. Celebrated annually on August 4, International Owl Awareness Day not only honors their presence in nature but also raises awareness about the threats they face.<br><br>Featured here is a nesting pair of great gray owls. Known as the world's largest owl species by length, which ranges from 24 to 33 inches, they span the Northern Hemisphere and are found in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Unlike many birds, they don't build their own nests—instead, they repurpose those left behind by large raptors or settle into broken treetops and hollow trunks. Despite their size and status as apex predators, they are non-aggressive, rarely clashing with rivals or intruders. However, during the fledgling stage, the female fiercely protects her vulnerable and flightless young.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202508.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./PCCLdadgWPIoHC.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./fBFrIVRRSyOfMN.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
