In the 10th century (though possibly starting up to 5,000 years ago) humans excavated the tuff to create caves and catacombs that could fit thousands of dwellers.

Come winter, they pass by again on the swim south. The entire round-trip route clocks in at about 12,000 miles, making gray whales among the longest migrators of the animal kingdom. Because they travel close to the coastline, it's also one of the few whale migrations you can see from shore.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XtYhsPdcxHlXIh.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.CharlestonAzaleas_EN-US1112132446_800x600.jpg" alt="Azaleas in bloom at Magnolia Plantation and Gardens"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Azaleas in bloom at Magnolia Plantation and Gardens</h2><p class="date">March 27, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Azaleas are in peak bloom during March at the Magnolia Plantation and Gardens near Charleston, South Carolina.

Built atop this Spanish island in 1863 at 689 feet above sea level, the beacon still shines (by solar power now), protecting ships from the rocky coastline below. The wild and rugged Cap de Formentor is accessible by a twisty road that offers incomparable views along the way—including several beautiful beaches and, since 1929, the Hotel Formentor, a glamorous icon for Mediterranean jetsetters. During its heyday in the mid-20th century, the hotel was a destination for celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin, Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Prince Rainier III of Monaco. Today, the cape is less known for its star-studded past and more for protecting and conserving its natural and unspoiled beauty.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mdmDLSTLWXpxEg.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BorrowingDays_EN-US1332727011_800x600.jpg" alt="A European crested tit weathers a storm in Scotland"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">A European crested tit weathers a storm in Scotland</h2><p class="date">March 29, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This photo of a European crested tit weathering a late-winter storm in Scotland may sum up the way some of us living in the Northern Hemisphere feel about the month of March. While the calendar tells us spring has arrived, the weather often seems to disagree. It's the blustery, unpredictable elements of this time of year that inspired an old Western European folktale that the month of March 'borrowed' three days from April so that it could indulge in a few final winter-like days. These 'borrowed days' are the last three days of the month. Perhaps take comfort that it's only three days. In some parts of Ireland, March borrowed nine days. That's too many days.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/nlfSpDpVCnazsj.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GalesnjakIsland_EN-US8495200916_800x600.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Galešnjak Island on the Adriatic coast of Croatia"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Aerial view of Galešnjak Island on the Adriatic coast of Croatia</h2><p class="date">March 30, 2020</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">We hope this aerial view of Galešnjak, or Love Island, serves as inspiration to spread some love today via our newest feature: Give Mode.

The Twist seems like an intrusion from the future amidst the dense woods and preserved historical buildings of Jevnaker, Norway, home to the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park. The Twist is a bridge, but also an art gallery. Its unique construction features straight slats set at increasing angles as one moves toward the center—'like a stack of books,' as its architects at the Bjarke Ingels Group describe it—to create a 90-degree turn where a wall becomes the ceiling and vice versa.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/wNuLYwuXbxhVlA.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SirThomasMore_EN-US9546326212_200x200.jpg" alt="Shakespeare's handwriting from the play 'Sir Thomas More"></div><div class="explore-label">Shakespeare's handwriting from the play 'Sir Thomas More</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/LNyXrFNJsTpxjZ.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SaltonSea_EN-US9699729653_200x200.jpg" alt="A heron perches on a piling at the Salton Sea in California"></div><div class="explore-label">A heron perches on a piling at the Salton Sea in California</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/UjzJAOjybGixjW.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.TheTwist_EN-US1554358364_200x200.jpg" alt="At the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park in Norway"></div><div class="explore-label">At the Kistefos Museum's sculpture park in Norway</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/hHmbsWSXYGsxue.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NoCaliCoast_EN-US0095184591_200x200.jpg" alt="Aerial view of the Big Sur coastline near Monterey"></div><div class="explore-label">Aerial view of the Big Sur coastline near Monterey</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/YhlXOjQPsrsjcs.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BronteBaths_EN-US9467599141_200x200.jpg" alt="Bird's-eye view of Bronte Baths ocean pool outside Sydney"></div><div class="explore-label">Bird's-eye view of Bronte Baths ocean pool outside Sydney</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
