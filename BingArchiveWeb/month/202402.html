Gillespie made his name in bebop, often called the first modern form of jazz, playing alongside other greats including Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Thelonious Monk.

At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public.

A leap year is a calendar oddity that exists because Earth's orbit and our usual year count are slightly out of sync. Earth takes 365.25 days to revolve around the sun. To compensate for those extra 5 hours, February gets an extra day—leap day—every four years. The concept, dating back to the ancient Romans, was refined in the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. While the purpose of the day is to keep our year aligned with the solar calendar, it can also serve as an extra day to prepare for spring! Cultures worldwide mark leap days and years with unique customs. In Ireland and Britain, women propose to men, in Greece, marrying during a leap year is said to bring misfortune, and in France, a satirical newspaper is published.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/ibVYBVtJdMYDCC.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HaghartsinMonastery_EN-US2523109486_200x200.jpg" alt="Haghartsin Monastery"></div><div class="explore-label">Haghartsin Monastery</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/BFnACcCgYjSKBI.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BamburghCastleUK_EN-US3358821704_200x200.jpg" alt="Bamburgh Castle"></div><div class="explore-label">Bamburgh Castle</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/adVeeHscgyvZtT.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ChinaDragon_EN-US6781838142_200x200.jpg" alt="Artists performing the dragon dance for Chinese New Year"></div><div class="explore-label">Artists performing the dragon dance for Chinese New Year</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/onJDIFMGBahqzf.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.GiantTortoise_EN-US7034846255_200x200.jpg" alt="Volcán Alcedo giant tortoises"></div><div class="explore-label">Volcán Alcedo giant tortoises</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/WopptZqAxgWyWc.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.WesternMonarchs_EN-US8386035297_200x200.jpg" alt="Monarch butterflies"></div><div class="explore-label">Monarch butterflies</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
