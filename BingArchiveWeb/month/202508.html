In La Jolla, California, tide pools teach you about ocean life—right at your feet. Along the rocky shoreline of this San Diego coastal neighborhood, tide pools form during low tide as seawater gets trapped in natural depressions. These shallow pools form naturally along La Jolla's rocky shorelines, especially near Windansea Beach, Shell Beach, South Casa Beach, and Hospital Point. The water that remains trapped in sandstone and reef depressions creates habitats for everything from sea hares to brittle stars. Over time, the tide pools are created through the process of erosion—waves hit the sandstone and limestone coastlines until they carve out pockets that hold water. Twice a day, as the tide moves in and out, these spaces flood and drain, challenging the survival skills of everything inside. Winter months, when tides are lowest during daylight hours, are ideal for observing them.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/yUqNFdgouzdkgG.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.NaPaliKauai_EN-US7451684312_800x600.jpg" alt="Kalalau Beach on the Nā Pali Coast"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Kalalau Beach on the Nā Pali Coast</h2><p class="date">August 6, 2025</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">No road signs, no souvenir stands—just 11 miles of mud, cliffs, and sweeping views leading to one of Hawaii's most remote beaches.

Once the site of a bustling market square known as the Plaza del Arrabal, this historic space has witnessed the city's transformation over the centuries. The shift began in 1561, when the plaza came under Madrid's jurisdiction after the royal court moved from Toledo.

Before Gering became a town in 1887 and decades before Nebraska achieved statehood in 1867, these sandstone and siltstone formations were already guiding thousands along the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails.
