This scene unfolds in 'World in Progress,' a monumental land art painting created by Swiss-French artist Saype in 2020. Made with biodegradable paint, the artwork depicts the vision and innocence at the heart of World Children's Day—a spirit mirrored in today's featured image. Look closer, and you'll spot the artist himself posing with his artwork.<br><br>Each year on November 20, the world unites to celebrate children and defend their rights. What began in 1954 as a UN initiative grew into a landmark observance anchored by two historic milestones: the 1959 Declaration and the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. These commitments have carved a global promise—one that speaks of education, equality, safety, and the simple right to be heard.<br><br>Today, UNICEF and communities around the world carry this vision forward through campaigns, conversations, and moments that encourage adults to pause—and truly listen to what children have to say.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202511.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./buHNufnoQlZCmO.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./rygcoiPAIIJsAn.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
