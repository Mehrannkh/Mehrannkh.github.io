But tell that to people who celebrate the Day of the Dead, or el Día de los Muertos, and they'll smile. They may explain that death is part of the circle of life, and as natural as any other human milestone. As our photo shows, the Day of the Dead is a big holiday in Mexico, where calacas—skeleton figures of musicians, workers, and other folks in merry scenes of everyday 'life'—lurk everywhere for weeks before the main event. Of course, living people also play dead for the day, donning skeleton outfits, masks, and grotesque makeup. Music, processions, and food add to the quirky, fun carnival atmosphere.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/yKErXRcTBcTvKP.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpruceGoose_EN-US0021752220_800x600.jpg" alt="The Hughes H-4 Hercules"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Hughes H-4 Hercules</h2><p class="date">November 2, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're looking back to a time when an eccentric billionaire's dream of reaching new heights was still a novel idea. It was 75 years ago today that Howard Hughes' 'flying boat,' dubbed the 'Spruce Goose,' made its one and only flight. Officially named the Hughes H-4 Hercules, the press persisted in calling it the 'Spruce Goose' even though it was constructed almost entirely of birch wood. The plane was commissioned in 1942 by American industrialist Henry Kaiser, who supplied ships to the US during World War II. Kaiser recruited Hughes—the film producer turned pilot, engineer, and business magnate—to build a flying cargo ship that could avoid German submarines while transporting troops and war supplies across the Atlantic. The contract called for three of the planes to be built within two years. Hughes was still working on the design when the war ended—in the end, he delivered only the one in our photo, two years after V-E Day.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/NyncmJubRpcCRk.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.AmboseliBioshere_EN-US9391999022_800x600.jpg" alt="Mount Kilimanjaro with Cape buffaloes in foreground"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Mount Kilimanjaro with Cape buffaloes in foreground</h2><p class="date">November 3, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">UNESCO designated November 3, 2022, the first annual International Day for Biosphere Reserves.

On average, they'll climb about 2.5 feet per year and under perfect conditions can grow as much as 10 feet in that time, eventually reaching around 60 feet tall. When dried, Cecropia leaves shrivel into a fist-like form which displays interesting patterns and shapes. Not only are Cecropias very popular with animals like sloths, monkeys, and toucans for their fruit and leaves, many species have a symbiotic relationship with Azteca ants.

Mars, popularly known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the sun, after Mercury, Venus, and Earth. We know more about Mars than any other planet but our own. That knowledge has been gained over centuries and has grown exponentially in recent years with the successful landings on Mars of the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers in 2012 and 2021 respectively. Today we celebrate those and other accomplishments on Red Planet Day, which coincides with the launch of Mariner 4, the first probe sent to Mars, on this day in 1964.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/cpbnpEcskBlCmM.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HeronGiving_EN-US9774285216_800x600.jpg" alt="Great blue herons building a nest in Wakodahatchee Wetlands"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Great blue herons building a nest in Wakodahatchee Wetlands</h2><p class="date">November 29, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The largest heron in North America, the great blue heron makes its nest in a 'basket' made from twigs, usually placed high in a tree. The herons line the interior with moss, leaves, grass, and other softer materials, and tend to return to the same nesting site each year, though not the same nest. The male heron finds building materials while the female assembles the nest, then both birds maintain and add to it. The helpful male heron shown here is presenting his mate with nesting material—he seems an apt mascot for this year's Giving Tuesday.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/jZitcasUzZebXq.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RovinjCroatia_EN-US9834093615_800x600.jpg" alt="The Old Town of Rovinj"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">The Old Town of Rovinj</h2><p class="date">November 30, 2022</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Beautiful, historic Rovinj dips into the Adriatic like a toe testing the water.
