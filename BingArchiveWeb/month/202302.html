The most well-known Groundhog Day celebration, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, was first promoted by a local newspaper editor in 1886. Thousands of people gather in Punxsutawney each year to witness the groundhog emerge from its burrow, and more importantly, to see if the critter spots its shadow. If it does, winter will go on for six weeks, according to tradition. If it does not, spring-like conditions are said to be coming. Studies have yet to prove any link between the two events, but that hasn’t cast a shadow over this unusual tradition, which remains as popular as ever in the 21st century.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/mEiTPLbAVFkFHN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.QuebecFrontenac_EN-US3034032069_800x600.jpg" alt="Château Frontenac"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Château Frontenac</h2><p class="date">February 3, 2023</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Among all the pre-Lenten celebrations that take place around the world in February, the most famous are associated with warm-weather cities like Rio and New Orleans, where revelers party in elaborate costumes during the run-up to Ash Wednesday.
