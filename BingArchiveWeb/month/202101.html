He conducted his first experiments 170 years ago, in early January 1851, with a relatively small prototype in the cellar of his home. Just a month later, Foucault performed his most famous pendulum demonstration, using a 62-pound spherical weight attached to a 220-foot wire, which was hung from the dome of the Panthéon, a Parisian monument. As the pendulum swung back and forth in a fixed plane, the pointed end of the weight traced lines in a compass-like circle of sand below it. As time passed, the angle of these lines began to change, demonstrating to onlookers that the Earth itself was rotating underneath the pendulum, and by extension, everyone watching was rotating as well, spinning on the surface of the great blue marble around its axis.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/oVczmvXuwvqQpR.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SpanishSeaSlug_EN-US5956865427_800x600.jpg" alt="Spanish shawl nudibranch on kelp off Santa Catalina Island"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Spanish shawl nudibranch on kelp off Santa Catalina Island</h2><p class="date">January 9, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Today we're meeting one of a motley group of sea slugs called the nudibranchs (rhymes with 'thanks'), known for their unique, often complex shapes and neon-bright colors that help discourage predators.

From the Barrier Reef to the rugged bush to the dry Outback, we invite you to join the diverse people of Oz in celebrating their island nation (well, we can almost join the Aussies—it's tomorrow for them already, so they celebrated yesterday).</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/zuPrjDbbatyMJe.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Taormina_EN-US5716711058_800x600.jpg" alt="Taormina"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Taormina</h2><p class="date">January 27, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">If you mistook this gorgeous, postcard-worthy image for one of the many coastal towns along Italy's famous Amalfi coast, you wouldn't be far off. However, the town seen here actually lies farther to the south, located on the eastern side of Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean. Beginning in the late 19th century, sun-seeking tourists have come to the chic resort town of Taormina during the warmer months, looking to dine in its restaurants, relax on its beaches, and of course just to take in the exquisite scenery.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/sTHNpOKFoMtfNN.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ArcticWolf_EN-US5836595388_800x600.jpg" alt="Arctic wolf family in Canada"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Arctic wolf family in Canada</h2><p class="date">January 28, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The Arctic wolf, or white wolf, is unique among wolves in its light coloring. Supremely adapted to the tundra where it lives, its coloration helps it blend into the landscape as it hunts the caribou, moose, muskox, and Arctic hare that make up its diet. A subspecies of the gray wolf, the Arctic wolf lives in the extreme north of Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands. It's extremely cold there, but an advantage of this habitat is that the remoteness has kept the Arctic wolf population from being hunted extensively. It is currently the only wolf species not endangered or threatened. We're featuring this handsome trio because tonight will be the Wolf Moon, traditionally the first full moon of the year. The name comes to us by way of the Algonquin people to denote the time of year that hungry wolves could be heard howling outside their settlements.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/xZKMjmVcCeJBzA.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.RedRobin_EN-US9299641141_800x600.jpg" alt="European robin during a winter snowstorm"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">European robin during a winter snowstorm</h2><p class="date">January 29, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">Winter often brings cold and snow to the uplands of England's Peak District National Park, as this wee European robin surely knows. Here we see it puffing up its plumage to insulate its body against the wintry weather. Unrelated to the American robin, the European robin is commonly known in the British Isles as the robin redbreast. But it's more orange than red, you say? That's because when British people first named it the redbreast, probably in the 1400s, the word 'orange' had not yet been introduced as a color name in the English language. Animals and other things were often named 'red' even when orange or tawny: the red deer, Red Planet, and robin redbreast are all examples. Whatever you decide to call our diminutive friend, we appreciate its bright splash of color on an otherwise bleak wintry day.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/IjcArAbLxdynUK.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeedVault_EN-US9343000928_800x600.jpg" alt="Svalbard Global Seed Vault with a glittering facade designed by artist Dyveke Sanne"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Svalbard Global Seed Vault with a glittering facade designed by artist Dyveke Sanne</h2><p class="date">January 30, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">This glittering concrete monolith is a lot like that still-sealed emergency survival kit languishing in your basement since 1999: Reassuring to have around, but a bummer when you actually have to use it. The Svalbard Global Seed Vault—better known by its cute nickname, the 'Doomsday Vault'—was established on this far-northern Norwegian isle in 2008 to archive frozen genetic copies of seeds already housed in seed banks around the world: a backup of all the backups. Kept at minus 0.4 degrees F within the seed vault, precious botanicals from food to fibers to flowers are safe from disasters, even of the apocalyptic variety.

By hiking in, of course. There are well over 1,000 such huts dotting the Alpine landscape throughout Europe, most of them built and maintained by private social clubs devoted to climbing, hiking, and other activities in the mountains. These huts allow hikers to light out onto the extensive trail systems, sometimes for days, while carrying as little gear as possible. No need to pack cooking equipment, tents and sleeping bags when you have guaranteed shelter each night, with dinners, breakfasts, and, if you're lucky, a hot shower, included.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a></main><aside class="explore-sidebar"><div class="explore-card"><h2 class="explore-title">Explore more:</h2><div class="explore-list"><a href="../ImgWeb/IjcArAbLxdynUK.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.SeedVault_EN-US9343000928_200x200.jpg" alt="Svalbard Global Seed Vault with a glittering facade designed by artist Dyveke Sanne"></div><div class="explore-label">Svalbard Global Seed Vault with a glittering facade designed by artist Dyveke Sanne</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/ZnsIGksAvaFgzd.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PailonDelDiablo_EN-US4820504961_200x200.jpg" alt="Agoyán waterfall near Baños de Agua Santa"></div><div class="explore-label">Agoyán waterfall near Baños de Agua Santa</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/JjkVApQwnIMpTj.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Molas_EN-US5410137458_200x200.jpg" alt="Handicrafts of the Guna people of the Guna Yala archipelago"></div><div class="explore-label">Handicrafts of the Guna people of the Guna Yala archipelago</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/tFJNaXcuHhMKqx.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.BolivianSummer_EN-US6076997237_200x200.jpg" alt="Flamingos in the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve in Bolivia"></div><div class="explore-label">Flamingos in the Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve in Bolivia</div></a><a href="../ImgWeb/vwoobKdkZdDdBc.html" class="explore-item"><div class="explore-thumb"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.Calakmul_EN-US4913753574_200x200.jpg" alt="Ruins of the ancient Maya city of Calakmul surrounded by jungle in Campeche"></div><div class="explore-label">Ruins of the ancient Maya city of Calakmul surrounded by jungle in Campeche</div></a></div></div></aside></div></div><script>document.querySelectorAll('.more-btn').forEach(btn => {
