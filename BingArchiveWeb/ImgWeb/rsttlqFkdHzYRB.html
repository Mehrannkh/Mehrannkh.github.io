The city was founded in 206 BCE by the Roman general Scipio as a place to house veterans from the Second Punic Wars. Itálica was also the birthplace of at least two Roman emperors.<br><br>For centuries, Itálica was an elaborate urban center with a temple, a theater, public baths, gorgeous homes for the monied elite, and a population of about 8,000 residents. This aerial view is of the city's famous amphitheater. It was built during the reign of Hadrian, who was emperor of Rome between the years 117 and 138 CE. Itálica's amphitheater was one of the largest in the Roman Empire. Thousands of spectators came from near and far to watch bloody gladiator fights, hunts of wild beasts, and public executions. The 'entertainment' here was not for the faint of heart.<br><br>Today, the modern Spanish city of Santiponce has grown up around—and even atop—the ruins. Tourists come here to walk the preserved Roman streets, admire the mosaics, and imagine the scenes of life and death that happened in this amphitheater nearly 2,000 years ago.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202110.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./hnjLajFAxXgrRj.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./JfgnROzERpAWnG.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
