But today actually is Groundhog Day. This marmot in Austria popped up to see…a rainbow? We're not sure what that means for the weather forecast, but it feels like a good sign. (The groundhog is a type of North American marmot.) In the US, the tradition says that if the groundhog sees its shadow, six more weeks of winter are in store. If it doesn't, then we're looking at an early spring. There's no science behind it; the custom has its roots in Pennsylvania Dutch culture and was popularized by the Punxsutawney Spirit newspaper in Pennsylvania in 1887—and again by the Bill Murray movie in 1993.</p><button class="more-btn">... more</button></div></div></article></a><a href="../ImgWeb/XVagcQwRbcfZGd.html" class="image-link"><article class="image-card"><img src="https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.MountNemrut_EN-US9552662409_800x600.jpg" alt="Colossal limestone statues on Mount Nemrut"><div class="text-overlay"><h2 class="title">Colossal limestone statues on Mount Nemrut</h2><p class="date">February 3, 2021</p><div class="description-wrapper"><p class="description short">The ruins on Mount Nemrut depict a gaggle of gods from both Greek and Persian traditions, plus a few deities that King Antiochus I made up himself.

Some also eat coral, which they grind up with plate-like teeth in their throats. Researchers say parrotfish play a critical role in the health of coral reefs by eating algae that can choke off coral growth. They also help replenish the white sandy beaches near these tropical reefs. How? After parrotfish digest the edible parts of coral, they excrete what's left as sand—a lot of sand.

The lyrical, uncompromising novel is narrated by an unnamed Black man who describes his agonizing search for identity in a society largely hostile to African Americans and blind to the suffering and indignities of the Black experience. The sculpture bears an inscription of the novel's opening words: 'I am an invisible man…I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me.'
