The beautiful mural we highlight today epitomizes the wondrous alchemy that is jazz. Even its location—the junction of the North Beach, Chinatown, and Barbary Coast neighborhoods in San Francisco—symbolizes a dynamic nexus of heritage and experience galvanized by a musical form that has unleashed creative genius for more than a century.<br><br>Artist Bill Weber named his piece 'Jazz' when he first painted the mural in 1987, and it features such leading lights of the music as Teddy Wilson on piano, Gene Krupa playing drums, and Benny Goodman with his signature clarinet.<br><br>Jazz originated in the early 20th century as a blending of European harmonic structures and African rhythms. It grew out of ragtime and blues music among African American musicians in and around New Orleans, but quickly spread to other parts of the US and eventually around the world. Jazz has continually evolved ever since, introducing such forms as bebop, jazz fusion, acid jazz, and many more.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202204.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./YxckLskvaXhlBu.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./vxwBtPhMJOqknr.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
