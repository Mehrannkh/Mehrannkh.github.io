At nearly 28 inches in length and weighing more than 3 pounds, it is about a quarter heavier than the common raven. Its enormous, arched bill—pale at the base and close to 3.5 inches long—is the largest among perching birds. These ravens live mostly between 5,000 and 11,200 feet above sea level, found across farmland, rocky cliffs, and even rooftops in mountain towns.<br><br>Thick-billed ravens are versatile feeders, taking carrion, insects, beetle larvae, seeds, and crops like wheat, along with scraps from people. Observers have seen them pulling grubs from dung heaps and even forcing Verreaux's eagle-owls from their nests. Often seen in pairs or small groups, they build large stick nests on cliffs or tall trees, laying three to five bluish-green eggs. Their calls range from deep croaks to wheezy notes, and rare instances of mimicry have been recorded. Their plumage gleams purple in sunlight, a striking figure of the African highlands. Classified as 'least-concern' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the thick-billed raven continues to thrive.</div><button class="toggle-btn" id="toggleBtn">more...</button></div><a href="../month/202510.html" class="back-link">← Back to Gallery</a><a href="./BkcTAhdOOnWFlW.html" class="nav-btn">Previous</a><a href="./HLtnEgcVbmWgaS.html" class="nav-btn">Next →</a></div><script> const toggleBtn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn'); const descriptionText = document.getElementById('descriptionText'); toggleBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { if (descriptionText.classList.contains('collapsed')) { descriptionText.classList.remove('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'less...'; } else { descriptionText.classList.add('collapsed'); toggleBtn.textContent = 'more...'; } }); const notice = document.getElementById('site-notice'); const closeBtn = document.getElementById('notice-close'); notice.classList.add('visible'); closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => { notice.classList.remove('visible'); setTimeout(() => { notice.style.display = 'none'; }, 400); }); </script></body></html>
